Speaker 1
Katherine Verona, on behalf of the defendant, circle K stores. Wanted to review hand. We saw the testimony about potentially the truth, the whole truth, and nothing about this incident because I knew.

00:01:28:20 - 00:01:33:04
Speaker 2
Good afternoon. Doctor. Could you please introduce yourself to the jury?

00:01:33:06 - 00:01:38:20
Speaker 3
Sure. Doctor. M Christopher McLaren, D.O., fellow American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

00:01:38:22 - 00:01:41:02
Speaker 2
And what type of doctor are you?

00:01:41:04 - 00:02:04:11
Speaker 3
So I am a dual board certified orthopedic surgeon. I have a certification in orthopedic surgery where I did a military, Army trauma postgraduate fellowship training, and I also am board certified as a sports medicine orthopedic surgeon, which means that I'm dual board certified and I perform arthroscopy in sports medicine, surgery, and extremities. It's a limited to extremity work.

00:02:04:11 - 00:02:11:19
Speaker 3
I do not do spine or hand surgery. Okay. So.

00:02:11:21 - 00:02:31:00
Speaker 2
And I'm, I'm sure a lot of the jury knows exactly what that is. What an orthopedic surgeon. But, if you could explain in general terms what that means to be that type of doctor, you were explaining extremities and, arthroscopy. Can you explain that in a little greater detail, please, for the jury here.

00:02:31:06 - 00:03:04:17
Speaker 3
So an orthopedic surgeon basically is a surgeon of the musculoskeletal system. So it ranges from anything from broken bones, torn muscles, torn ligaments, torn tendons. Layman's terms, if you see someone with a fractured wrist or a fractured ankle, that's what an orthopedic surgeon would then take care of. If you go through the emergency department for soft tissue injuries such as a torn muscle or torn Achilles, if you're watching a football game and you see someone tear their knee up and they go through the orthopedic surgeon department, then they have a ligament surgery done, reconstructive surgery.

00:03:04:17 - 00:03:12:18
Speaker 3
So we're basically, human mechanics. We fix all of the, bones and soft tissue structures of the body.

00:03:12:20 - 00:03:18:09
Speaker 2
Thank you. Doctor. And can you give the jury the benefit of your educational background, please?

00:03:18:11 - 00:03:42:23
Speaker 3
So I graduated with honors cum laude from the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. I went on to go to medical school at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where I graduated number one of my class in political science. I then went on to perform an orthopedic surgery residency, at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was awarded chief residency, honors.

00:03:43:00 - 00:04:07:24
Speaker 3
And with that, I scored and my written orthopedic surgery boards, 96% my oral, 95%, my clinical board's 95%. So with that, I was invited to become a board examiner. After my residency, I did post-graduate, fellowship training in sports medicine and arthroscopy at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas and then as an active duty Army combat surgeon.

00:04:07:24 - 00:04:52:19
Speaker 3
I was then, put into trauma surgery training at the esteemed Parkland Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, known for where Kennedy went for the assassination. I serve my country for five years as an active duty, combat surgeon. Was deployed to Afghanistan immediately after 911 with the 101st airborne, where I served as their combat surgeon. Throughout my combat surgery, experience in Afghanistan, I was proud to say, received a coveted combat medical badge and award from General Tommy Franks for 21 combat saves in theater, and also a mature Meritorious Service Medal for combat under fire during Tora Bora, during the hunt for bin laden.

00:04:52:21 - 00:05:13:10
Speaker 3
So following my military career, I served my five years that was honorably discharged, and during that time was board certified and then recertified ten years later when I was in private practice, I started a private practice in Tampa, Florida. One of the proudest things I did is after the military is I became a professor of orthopedic surgery.

00:05:13:12 - 00:05:31:23
Speaker 3
So since 2009, at USF and at Nova Southeastern, USF being University of South Florida and Nova Southeastern, I've been able to train medical students and residents and preparing them for board certification, since then. And I've enjoyed private practice for now, 25 years.

00:05:32:00 - 00:05:36:04
Speaker 2
Thank you. Doctor, can you explain to the jury what it means to be board certified?

00:05:36:06 - 00:06:12:13
Speaker 3
So board certification is the highest standard of any surgeon or doctor's profession? It means that you have met, a higher standard of education, and cases that you've performed as well as, done the appropriate academic curriculum. In order to do that, you take a written examination, mind, at least at the time, was 400 questions and you take an oral examination, which at the time, mine was eight hours, where you can be asked anything from any realm of surgery, spine surgery, pediatric surgery, tumor surgery.

00:06:12:15 - 00:06:34:15
Speaker 3
And once you complete those two phases, the third phase is 2 to 3 board examiners come in and watch you operate. They watch you operate whether they deem 2 or 3 cases. And once they think and deem that you are qualified, then and only then you get your board certification for the first time. Very rigorous. Usually takes two years after your your residency is completed.

00:06:34:17 - 00:07:02:05
Speaker 3
Following that, to maintain your board certification, you have to take a recertification and that is an exam every ten years, usually 200 to 250 questions and current, keeping you current current principals, current orthopedic practices. And so since then, I've been board certified twice in two different certifications and re certified twice and passed them all.

00:07:02:07 - 00:07:10:12
Speaker 2
And so aside from your education at night, no, we're in your work life. Who do you currently work for and for how long?

00:07:10:14 - 00:07:22:08
Speaker 3
So currently I work for Complete Care Centers. I am a 1099 hired consultant. I started with them August of 2018.

00:07:22:10 - 00:07:32:05
Speaker 2
And in your role at Complete Care, you're a board certified surgeon as well. I understanding and specialize in orthopedic trauma and fracture care.

00:07:32:07 - 00:07:40:24
Speaker 3
Trauma, fracture care and sports medicine surgery, which is minimally invasive surgery of the extremity, shoulder, elbow and knee.

00:07:41:01 - 00:07:43:22
Speaker 2
And you're the medical director at this facility?

00:07:43:24 - 00:07:46:03
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:07:46:05 - 00:07:49:16
Speaker 2
What what are those duties entail as a medical director?

00:07:49:21 - 00:08:16:03
Speaker 3
So they entail I oversee the for what we call medical hubs. What that means is the medical hubs contain the specialists, spine surgeons, extremity surgeons, pain management, interventional spine surgeons, neurologists, basically the clinical, surgical specialties. So I oversee those and I do chart audits, and I do basically answer all questions from all of our mid-level providers.

00:08:16:03 - 00:08:55:21
Speaker 3
They have open access to ask me questions on MRI reviews. Patient care. So I oversee the mid-level providers. My next hat I wear is education. So I do all of the educational, I guess, seminars for all of our new employees, for all of our, mid-level providers, medical assistance nurse practitioners, physician assistants. And the last one I do is I basically oversee, basically as a fireman, oversee any, problems that may arise within providers of providers, have, issues or problems.

00:08:55:21 - 00:08:58:17
Speaker 3
They come to me.

00:08:58:19 - 00:09:08:02
Speaker 2
Okay. And so as the medical director, it fair to say that you oversee a lot of surgeries within the clinic.

00:09:08:04 - 00:09:17:04
Speaker 3
I am the medical director for the extremities, so I oversee those. I don't oversee any of the spine, procedures.

00:09:17:06 - 00:09:20:21
Speaker 2
Would you oversee knee surgeries on a regular basis?

00:09:21:02 - 00:09:23:24
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:09:24:01 - 00:09:42:20
Speaker 2
No, doctor, we're here with regard to one of your patients, Brandon Page, my co-counsel and I represent Brandon. And a claim for an incident where he had slipped and fell to what floor? Entering a gas station, resulting in an injury. Is that your understanding of the incident that Brandon mentioned to you while you were treating him?

00:09:42:22 - 00:09:44:17
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:09:44:19 - 00:09:50:02
Speaker 2
And do you have medical records, reports or films with you today? Regarding Brandon?

00:09:50:04 - 00:09:51:11
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:09:51:13 - 00:10:06:14
Speaker 2
So, doctor, if you need to refer to those at any point for your testimony today, please feel free to do so. No. Doctor, could you please tell us exactly what you brought in terms of records and other information? With respect to Brandon.

00:10:06:16 - 00:10:42:15
Speaker 3
So I have medical records that start with, new patient intake that he had, filled out and filled out in his own handwriting. It's dated 617, 20, 20. It corresponds with a initial evaluation that he had, done by trying to see who did the. On June 23rd of 2020, he was seen for an initial eval by Judith Plummer Morgan, nurse practitioner.

00:10:42:17 - 00:11:26:18
Speaker 3
And then he was also seen before he saw me by, orthopedic physician assistant San Sabelo on 813 of 2020. The rest of the records I have are an MRI of his right knee dated 827, 2020. I have my initial consultation dated 1019, 2020 of my operative report from Orlando Center for Outpatient Surgery dated 330 2021. I have a post-op progress note dated for 13, 2021, and that's it.

00:11:26:20 - 00:11:31:14
Speaker 2
With all those records and reports and films, refresh your recollection today regarding Brandon.

00:11:31:16 - 00:11:33:00
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:11:33:02 - 00:11:38:05
Speaker 2
Are the records and films and reports kept in the normal course of your business and medical practice? I complete care.

00:11:38:07 - 00:11:39:19
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:11:39:21 - 00:11:54:07
Speaker 2
Were those same records and reports and films made at or near the time, Brandon was being treated? I complete care for neck and knee injuries. I'm sorry. I was neck and back and knee injuries and pain.

00:11:54:09 - 00:11:55:21
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:11:55:23 - 00:12:04:07
Speaker 2
And is this, regular practice for your office and medical facilities where you perform surgeries to make these types of records and reports?

00:12:04:09 - 00:12:06:23
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:12:07:00 - 00:12:16:03
Speaker 2
And, doctor, I it's obvious, obviously, you you've treated them while you were there, but, at one point you did provide care and treatment to Brandon, correct?

00:12:16:05 - 00:12:17:00
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:12:17:02 - 00:12:28:15
Speaker 2
And, you just kind of walk through the dates, with us, but it sounds like you saw him on October 19th of 2020. Is that is that correct?

00:12:28:17 - 00:12:29:19
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:12:29:21 - 00:12:37:06
Speaker 2
And what complaints did Brandon present you, with at your practice?

00:12:37:08 - 00:13:01:21
Speaker 3
So Brandon stated his right knee was sharp. Right. His knee gets stiff. It does not radiate. His biggest complaint was instability in the right knee. Is pain radiates anywhere from, to, at it's best to seven out of ten on. It's worse for ten is the worst than a pain scale. He has pain constantly. It's worse with walking, standing, turning and moving.

00:13:01:23 - 00:13:20:05
Speaker 3
It's improved with stretching and wearing a knee brace. He also reports that his activities of daily living are affected, including household chores, child care, driving, exercising, social activities, sleeping, occupational activities.

00:13:20:07 - 00:13:28:20
Speaker 2
And doctors. My understanding that you have the benefit of reviewing, diagnostic imaging of Brandon's, right knee. Is that is that correct?

00:13:29:01 - 00:13:29:24
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:13:30:01 - 00:13:35:21
Speaker 2
And it's also my understanding you performed a physical examination of Brandon when you met him for the first time.

00:13:35:23 - 00:13:37:18
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:13:37:20 - 00:13:47:06
Speaker 2
And what were the findings after your consults with him in reviewing the imaging and performing the physical examinations of Brandon.

00:13:47:08 - 00:14:01:21
Speaker 3
So the findings were he had a significant and quite large what we call a horizontal cleavage tear of his medial meniscus that encompassed about 50% of the surface area of it.

00:14:01:23 - 00:14:23:15
Speaker 2
And I thought I had read in the OP report that under the pre-op diagnosis and the post-op diagnosis, there's a second item where, it's hypertrophic by this right knee with a medial synovial plaque, a band. Can you explain to me what that is?

00:14:23:17 - 00:14:46:02
Speaker 3
Yes, sir. So whenever we have a meniscal injury or an injury to the knee, the normal lining, think of it like a Saran wrap lining inside the knee. It's called synovial lining. So it's the lining that secretes synovial fluid. So all of our joints have fluid in it. So hypertrophic means, expanding or getting larger. Hyper meaning larger trophic means thickening.

00:14:46:08 - 00:15:05:01
Speaker 3
So it's a larger thickened synovial lining that looks, you know, like a big, big, thick carpet that shouldn't be in there because it should be a thin lining. Instead, it's tripled in size, quadruple in size, and a plaque. A band is a band of tissue that runs medially and it rubs. It's like a friction rub, so the synovial lining gets so thick.

00:15:05:01 - 00:15:24:09
Speaker 3
If it's inside the knee joint and it's tripling in size now it's rubbing on the knee area. So that's part of the injury. It's just basically like a swollen, synovial lining. So we see that when we put a camera in and once we see that, we remove it because it's it's causing pain, it's causing impingement.

00:15:24:11 - 00:15:30:24
Speaker 2
And, doctor, you diagnosed Brandon with a complex, right knee complex tear of a medial meniscus.

00:15:31:01 - 00:15:32:01
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:15:32:03 - 00:15:41:08
Speaker 2
And then we were just talking about the second, diagnosis, right? With the, the synovial, the fluid in the knee. Right.

00:15:41:10 - 00:15:48:00
Speaker 3
The synovial lining is the thickening of the lining, the thickening of, the lining tissue of the knee. Correct.

00:15:48:02 - 00:15:55:03
Speaker 2
As to those diagnosis, is that opinion more likely than not, within a reasonable degree of medical probability and certainty?

00:15:55:05 - 00:15:59:18
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:15:59:20 - 00:16:08:02
Speaker 2
In layman's terms, doctor, can you just describe the nature and extent of the right knee injury that, Brandon sustained?

00:16:08:04 - 00:16:28:17
Speaker 3
Sure. So it's a twisting injury. So, yeah, I kind of drew it out for you guys. Confirmed my knee model. But if we look at the knee, this is the inside part of the knee. If you reach down and touch your knee on the inside part, it's called the medial side. So what he sustained was in this picture, he had split his meniscus cartilage.

00:16:28:17 - 00:16:46:15
Speaker 3
The knee is two kinds of cartilage. And it's got the covering cartilage like you see on the end of a chicken bone. And then it's got the meniscal cartilage, which are the little rubbery O-rings because they look like O-rings or they're washers and they have two functions. They bumper the knee from being bone on bone, and they act as a cup and saucer stabilizer.

00:16:46:17 - 00:17:09:09
Speaker 3
So here's a better picture. You can see the O-ring here. This is on the outside. The over here on the inside a normal medial meniscus looks like a rubbery shape. But Brandon Page had split his like this into a horizontal cleavage. And then on top of that, he had a flipped piece that came flipping out like this, like a tongue or kind of like a.

00:17:09:11 - 00:17:24:19
Speaker 3
I don't know if I guess. Here it is. It was flipping back and forth, causing a painful clicking, part. And that's why we call it a complex tear. It's torn in two different planes.

00:17:24:21 - 00:17:40:15
Speaker 2
Doctor did the medical records in the notes that you reviewed, pertaining to Brandon, indicate that the incident he reported to his doctors, including you, was the slip and fall on a wet floor entering a gas station on June 6th of 2020.

00:17:40:17 - 00:17:42:19
Speaker 3
That's correct.

00:17:42:21 - 00:17:48:05
Speaker 2
And do you have an opinion as to what caused the diagnosis that you came up with?

00:17:48:07 - 00:18:10:01
Speaker 3
So the configuration that you see there that I drew out is a horizontal cleavage tear. And that can't happen without a traumatic event. So that's a bottle cap effect or twisting effect. I wish I had my knee model, but if you think of the knee this way, like I drew in the picture, when you twist the knee like that, it tears that meniscus because it's a shear force.

00:18:10:03 - 00:18:37:21
Speaker 3
So in light of the fact that at 30, what does the 31 years old, 31 years old, he has no degenerative changes, no arthritic changes, no degenerative meniscus. He has nothing, that precludes him from having any kind of arthritic changes in his knee. And we could see that on the pictures that I took. And the only way to have a split horizontal tear like that with a displaced fragment is to have a traumatic event to that knee.

00:18:37:23 - 00:18:44:02
Speaker 3
So the traumatic event is a load and twist like a bottle cap twisting.

00:18:44:04 - 00:18:49:14
Speaker 2
Is that opinion more likely than not within a reasonable degree of medical probability uncertainty?

00:18:49:16 - 00:18:53:12
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:18:53:14 - 00:19:01:03
Speaker 2
Doctor, are you aware of any injury to Brandon's right knee prior to this incident? On six six, 20?

00:19:01:05 - 00:19:15:07
Speaker 3
No. He stated he had a left knee meniscus repair in 2012, but he stated he did not have any injury to the right knee prior.

00:19:15:09 - 00:19:27:11
Speaker 2
Doctor, I want to talk about the treatment, and the surgery that you provided. Brandon, is the goal of your treatment that you provided Brandon to relieve pain and maximize function?

00:19:27:13 - 00:19:29:11
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:19:29:13 - 00:19:35:04
Speaker 2
And sometimes to accomplish that, does that include surgical intervention?

00:19:35:06 - 00:19:52:24
Speaker 3
Yes, sir. For for his injury and his size tear. There was not a lot of options. He was just going to proceed there progressively get worse with the configuration of this tear. If you don't repair this, you're going to lose almost all of your meniscus cartilage over the next year or two.

00:19:53:01 - 00:20:01:15
Speaker 2
So Brandon needed this surgery to relieve the pain in his knee, repair it, and maximize function. Is that fair?

00:20:01:17 - 00:20:29:10
Speaker 3
Yes. And I would also add to preserve the knees condition. So what I mean by that is when we repair the meniscus, we're preventing that meniscus from future retailers. Were also preventing that meniscus from not functioning correctly. So the key wording we use now in the academy orthopedic sports medicine is joint preservation technique. So truly, it's not now that he'll reap the benefit of that joint preservation.

00:20:29:10 - 00:20:45:06
Speaker 3
But it's 10 or 15 years from now where we have saved that meniscus and thus keeping the mechanics of the knee from getting early degenerative under arthritic conditions. Nothing you won't, but at least we're giving it a fighting chance.

00:20:45:08 - 00:21:05:05
Speaker 2
So moving into the the treatments, the surgery, I kind of broke him out into four categories, because that's kind of how the report said, set forth the the procedures that were performed. The first one was I, I'm reading a right knee arthroscopy. Can you explain to us what that is?

00:21:05:07 - 00:21:26:16
Speaker 3
Correct. So an arthroscopy, just like what's in this picture, is basically taking a little camera about the size of this pen and taking a little camera and making one small poke hole and putting it right here, and then taking an instrument with the same poco and putting another little poco. And you can see everything in the knee, with that camera.

00:21:26:16 - 00:21:46:20
Speaker 3
And you can repair things. You can visualize things very well. Even though these are black and white, I think you can all see it. So this is what it what I'd be looking at, I'd be looking inside is me with the camera. And then you can see here, this picture. That's a great picture. That's the horizontal cleavage, split hair I was talking about.

00:21:46:20 - 00:22:02:04
Speaker 3
You could see where his meniscus is split all the way. And then this piece right here is a free fragment. See how it pops in and out like a kind of a jack in the box. It's popping back and forth, and that's what's giving him all of that. That incessant pain. It's like a car hood flipping over on itself.

00:22:02:04 - 00:22:18:17
Speaker 3
So these are even though they're black and white, the color photos are great, but if you see the black white, you can kind of see it from there. So this is what I'm seeing with a tiny incision. And then I can fix things with mini instruments through the nether. Here's a great picture. Here's that little jack in the box.

00:22:18:17 - 00:22:37:01
Speaker 3
You see those? Both of them. It's not really a technical term, but you can see here this whole fragment has popped back out from where his knee is torn. There's the horizontal piece. But look how large this piece was. What flipped. And it's in between is two joint but the part of his joint. So this is this is a menace right here.

00:22:37:03 - 00:22:41:02
Speaker 2
And that menace is what was causing him pain, in your opinion?

00:22:41:04 - 00:22:51:11
Speaker 3
Pain and instability. Correct. That was the that was the the main, generator of pain and instability and swelling.

00:22:51:13 - 00:23:08:02
Speaker 2
So moving on to the second line item in the procedures performed. I'm, I'm reading right knee medial meniscus repair using a suture anchor. Now, that is that addressing that those tears that you were just describing on the picture.

00:23:08:04 - 00:23:29:02
Speaker 3
Correct. So it's this is a kind of a two phase. So the first phase is the this piece is dead. I mean, this cartilage flap, this this chunky piece that's flipping back, you can't repair that. It's a dead piece of tissue. So that gets resected, that gets removed. And then the rest of the meniscus right here where the split here is, this is where I would insert a meniscal repair anchor.

00:23:29:04 - 00:23:50:15
Speaker 3
And you can't see it great here. But there's a suture that repairs this. And what that does is it prevents that horizontal cleavage tear from propagating. It prevents it from getting bigger. And it actually it actually stabilizes it. So we've done two things. We've removed the bad part because we can't do anything with it. And then we've repaired the good stuff that's left.

00:23:50:17 - 00:24:05:11
Speaker 2
And moving on to the third line item. This is going to be a struggle for me to pronounce, but I'll do my best to compartment Sinovac to me with the excision of a medial synovial. Pletka band.

00:24:05:13 - 00:24:25:04
Speaker 3
You did good. That's correct. So just like, we talked about before, inside the knee, this is not, If I had the color picture, it'd be great. But this is that medial synovial, like a band. So it's a thick band of tissue that sits here. And you can see here even in the black and white. Feel like I'm back in the 70s with TB, even in the black.

00:24:25:04 - 00:24:41:10
Speaker 3
And you could see it's rubbing on the condyle. So when you this is kind of a pain generator too. So you don't want to do a great job fixing the meniscus and having the patient go, yeah, it still hurts me right here. So this like a band is a direct relation to a traumatic events. We remove this where we go in there.

00:24:41:10 - 00:24:50:03
Speaker 3
So there's the before and then there's the after. You can see what's going. So that's kind of a that's kind of part of it. What you did good.

00:24:50:05 - 00:25:17:17
Speaker 2
The last one I think is going to be my biggest challenge. Because it's a long one. But I'd like I'd like you to describe in greater detail what exactly this this what you performed here, this procedure that you performed an item for, an inter consular notch, marrow stimulation, micro fracture control, plastic for a biological healing response to the meniscal repair.

00:25:17:19 - 00:25:45:18
Speaker 3
Correct. So kind of the standard of care in any meniscal repair is to add a micro stimulation technique. Some people will inject platelet rich plasma directly to the repair. The antiquated version was take someone's blood, products, make a clot out of it, and then you insert the clot into the repair. But an easier way that we found, the guys at the University of Pittsburgh found that if you just take an area where the notches.

00:25:45:20 - 00:26:09:19
Speaker 3
So I'll show you on this picture for I am so I'm right here in the notch, and this is chock full of really good marrow. And the marrow has got the stem cells and the healing cells for everything that we want. So what we do is we make insertion points here, and then the marrow free flows down into those channels and it'll bathe the repair and marrow stimulation has shown two things.

00:26:09:21 - 00:26:16:15
Speaker 3
One, it helps in the repair the speed of the repair, but it also prevents repair.

00:26:16:17 - 00:26:31:13
Speaker 3
So it's basically using it's using your own body's beautiful milieu of healing factors in your marrow. That's right there for the taking and helping. The healing response of that meniscus repair.

00:26:31:15 - 00:26:50:08
Speaker 2
Thank you doctor. And I think you've already kind of covered it, but you identified tears in the knee. The significant tares, I think is how you described it. But that's what caused you to recommend and perform these procedures to Brandon's right knee is up there?

00:26:50:10 - 00:26:53:20
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:26:53:22 - 00:26:58:23
Speaker 2
No, that's for the procedures. Are these invasive medical procedures.

00:26:59:00 - 00:27:16:22
Speaker 3
So all surgeries invasive no matter what, even if you have a toenail removed. So it's surgery. The fact that it's minimally invasive doesn't mean that it doesn't have surgical risks. They all have surgical risks. You can die. You could have a blood clot. You can have a heart attack. You can have a stroke. There's many things that you can even get an infection.

00:27:16:24 - 00:27:42:22
Speaker 3
Though the risks are small, though, the risks are minimal for minimally invasive surgery, it's still surgery. And even though we make it look really cool because we do it arthroscopic Lee, it's still surgery. I mean, you still have anesthesia and you still have risks of lung infections, pneumonia, things like that. So, I mean, like anything else, we treat it as a surgery, even though it is minimally invasive.

00:27:42:24 - 00:27:48:05
Speaker 2
Did Brandon lose parts of the knee and his knee anatomy as a result?

00:27:48:07 - 00:28:05:03
Speaker 3
He did. He lost about 40% of his medial meniscus. And that's that large, chunky flap tear I showed you that looked like a, kind of a rusty gate popping out or part of a tongue popping in and out. So yeah, he lost 40% of his meniscus.

00:28:05:05 - 00:28:19:03
Speaker 2
As for the procedures, doctor, I want you to kind of describe what expected outcomes. What are the expected, expected outcomes? If you could describe them for us?

00:28:19:05 - 00:28:36:16
Speaker 3
I will and I, I've actually done a lecture on this, and I lectured it to my residents. It's called The Young Patient with the Old Knee. So he's 31 now. He's what we call. And this is the lean in moment. This is the lean in for the jury. This is the lean in part. This is, he's meniscal deficient.

00:28:36:18 - 00:29:01:00
Speaker 3
And what that means is on one side of his knee, he's got a normal meniscus on the outside part and the inside part of his knee. He's missing 40%, which means he's got a 60% meniscus here and a 100% meniscus here. So over the course of time, look at the knee right here. Over the course of time, this part of the knee where the 40% is gone, we'll start to get degenerative.

00:29:01:00 - 00:29:22:03
Speaker 3
Get where the what we call post-traumatic arthritis. The side of the knee will be fine because it's got a full bumper. So like the pool ball on a bumper on a pool table. This one doesn't have a full bumper, so it's got about a 60% bumper. So over the course of time, not now, not next year, not the year after, but when Brandon Page is about 45 ish.

00:29:22:03 - 00:29:35:20
Speaker 3
The studies show 10 to 12 years. He will 100% have a degenerative medial compartment of his knee with early arthritic changes. That's a fact.

00:29:35:22 - 00:29:41:22
Speaker 2
Doctor, what is the expected timeframe for him to recover from the actual procedures?

00:29:41:24 - 00:29:47:04
Speaker 3
So for minimal repairs, most patients recover in about 12 weeks.

00:29:47:06 - 00:29:53:01
Speaker 2
And after that 12 week mark, are they bearing weight regularly on the knee?

00:29:53:03 - 00:30:14:19
Speaker 3
So we let them bear weights 80% for the first three weeks, and then we let them go for weight bearing in for weeks. And then usually by 12 weeks, they're able to have normal gait, meaning normal walking. They're able to do walk on treadmill. They're able to do biking, swimming. They're able to do, inline activities. What does that mean to walking in line?

00:30:14:21 - 00:30:31:03
Speaker 3
Riding a bike in line. But they're not allowed to do pivoting activities for six months. Pivoting, being racquetball, basketball, volleyball, pickleball, any of these side to side activities. And then we also protect the repair with a brace for six months.

00:30:31:05 - 00:30:51:09
Speaker 2
Like you are describing, Brandon's future and what you might expect in the future, starting at 45, around that age, would you expect there to be some limited range of motion?

00:30:51:11 - 00:30:52:14
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:30:52:16 - 00:30:56:02
Speaker 2
And pain would come along with that. Is that fair?

00:30:56:04 - 00:30:57:17
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:30:57:19 - 00:31:00:22
Speaker 2
We'll. Brandon's knee ever be 100% back to normal?

00:31:00:24 - 00:31:06:22
Speaker 3
No. Normal ended when he tore his meniscus out.

00:31:06:24 - 00:31:09:16
Speaker 2
You.

00:31:09:18 - 00:31:18:14
Speaker 2
Have you're experienced some patients avoiding or doing less exercise and less being less mobile? Due to this type of injury.

00:31:18:16 - 00:31:20:10
Speaker 3
All the time.

00:31:20:12 - 00:31:24:24
Speaker 2
And does that could carry on through life, 45 and beyond.

00:31:25:01 - 00:31:31:10
Speaker 3
Throughout life until the inevitable happens. And they need some sort of replacement surgery.

00:31:31:12 - 00:31:42:18
Speaker 2
Okay, so before a replacement surgery is there, we'll follow up, care for the for the procedures themselves. What do you what do what would you have Brandon do or what did you have Brandon do?

00:31:42:18 - 00:32:07:09
Speaker 3
I suppose so for right now Brandon can be Brandon. He can wear a sports knee brace and he can go on with his life because only 31. When Brandon starts to say in 5 to 6 years, my knee hurts when I jog, my knee hurts when I play with my kids, my knee hurts when I am going to the amusement park, and then you get an MRI on Brandon and you see that his cartilage on his covering cartilage is wearing down and it's starting to get degenerative.

00:32:07:11 - 00:32:38:22
Speaker 3
Then you start broaching the subject of biologics and biologics are gel supplementation to the knee mixed with platelet rich plasma injections and the potential? There's a new one out called fractionated adipose tissue, where you take some abdominal adipose tissue, fractionated down and inject that into the knee. And those all have been shown in studies to do three things one, take away some symptomatology, i.e. pain to slow down the process of degenerative.

00:32:38:22 - 00:33:00:16
Speaker 3
That's the buzzword. Slow down the process of the degenerative process. And number three, at least with platelet rich plasma, help some of the building blocks. And the gel injection also. So help some of the building blocks of the early degenerative cartilage restore themselves.

00:33:00:18 - 00:33:14:03
Speaker 2
As far as the, development of any osteoarthritis or arthritis, is that at a much earlier age that Brandon, you would expect? Brandon to potentially have those symptoms from those types of conditions?

00:33:14:05 - 00:33:14:16
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:33:14:16 - 00:33:17:06
Speaker 1
Objection outside the scope of the record. Sorry, doctor.

00:33:17:08 - 00:33:19:09
Speaker 3
It's okay. Yes. Let me let me.

00:33:19:11 - 00:33:31:03
Speaker 2
Let me ask this in a little different way. Can Brandon's injuries in his right knee lead to the development of osteoarthritis at an earlier age that it would, without the injury 100%?

00:33:31:03 - 00:33:44:08
Speaker 3
Yes, that's that's well documented. Over a thousand papers on post-traumatic arthritis of the knee. The big ones are meniscal deficiency. What's your meniscal deficient of over 20%. It escalates.

00:33:44:10 - 00:33:48:15
Speaker 2
And you testified that Brandon was 40% deficient. Correct?

00:33:48:17 - 00:33:51:13
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:33:51:15 - 00:33:59:23
Speaker 2
What are some typical symptoms that he might experience or you might expect him to experience in the future?

00:34:00:00 - 00:34:19:09
Speaker 3
Medial pain. Meaning pain on the inside part of his knee. Number two is swelling. Number three is the feeling of giving way. Number four is the deformity of the knee starts to collapse on the inside. Parts of the knee for him would start to look a little bit more bowlegged. He'd start to see his knee bending inward.

00:34:19:11 - 00:34:48:10
Speaker 3
The next one would be, nighttime pain. Pain that wakes you up at night. The next is difficulty getting up and down out of a chair, climbing stairs, getting in and out of a car, in up and down off a toilet seat. So your activities of daily living get compromised. And then with that, because of the degenerative joint line that is starting to wear and tear on the cartilage, starting to look like, shag carpet or crab meat, it's getting all shaggy and degenerative.

00:34:48:12 - 00:34:51:15
Speaker 3
You start to lose range of motion.

00:34:51:17 - 00:35:01:00
Speaker 2
Would you expect these issues with the Navy you're describing in the future? Would you expect them to cause any other issues to say, his back or his hip?

00:35:01:02 - 00:35:01:22
Speaker 3
See.

00:35:01:24 - 00:35:05:13
Speaker 1
It's actually outside the scope of the records. You can go ahead.

00:35:05:15 - 00:35:30:09
Speaker 3
You know, out of my realm, we call it the kinetic chain. More of a desire, trust, role, physical medicine and rehab role to comment on that. But, I mean, the kinetic chain is what it is. And if you have a degenerative knee on one side and not on the other, intuitively, and I don't know from I don't have the, the bandwidth to tell you the papers out there of the research of it.

00:35:30:11 - 00:35:42:24
Speaker 3
But intuitively, I would think that it would cause a disruption in the kinetic chain, which would then cause associated probable hip pain, back pain.

00:35:43:01 - 00:35:52:00
Speaker 2
Would you expect him to compensate on his good? His good? He won't compensate for the injured leg on his good leg.

00:35:52:02 - 00:36:28:23
Speaker 3
So it's hard to say. It depends on when we talk about compensate. Like I said, it's it's not now. It's not next year. Is that a year from now? It's about ten years from now. And then when you say compensate, usually it's not compensating. It's usually the other leg is is deficient. And so you start to see more of a limping and more of a, intelligent gait, meaning that they're not able to move the knee as best as they can on their good knee.

00:36:29:00 - 00:36:39:12
Speaker 2
Doctor, if Brendan is still experiencing some symptoms or some pain in his knee and your opinion, is it likely never going away?

00:36:39:14 - 00:36:58:20
Speaker 3
I you know, that's one of those questions that when you are subjective and you have subjective knee pain, you're going to have good days and bad days. You're going to have some treatments. Like I said, you can have the gel injections, the PRP injections. I wouldn't recommend corticosteroid injections. It's kind of been been thrown out by our academy, but you're going to have good days and bad days.

00:36:58:20 - 00:37:06:10
Speaker 3
The good days are going to come, and then the bad days are going to be if you went and walked around Disney for eight hours with your kids, you're gonna have a bad day.

00:37:06:12 - 00:37:13:06
Speaker 2
Would you classify Brandon's injuries from the June 6th, 2020 incident as being permanent injuries?

00:37:13:08 - 00:37:16:04
Speaker 3
Absolutely.

00:37:16:06 - 00:37:29:14
Speaker 2
And I know you were alluding to some some treatment in the future or potential treatment. I'll just ask you straight away, would Brandon benefit from continuing examinations and treatment related to this right knee injury in the future?

00:37:29:16 - 00:37:31:16
Speaker 1
Actually, outside the scope of the reports?

00:37:31:18 - 00:38:05:17
Speaker 3
No, absolutely. Whenever you know the standard. Right now for meniscal deficiency on a young individual is he needs to be seen every six months with imaging studies being X-rays and a post operative MRI done minimal at years one, three and five. For a lot of reasons one to look at the cartilage to to look at the repair and three, to start, documenting any early what we call conjugal Malaysia, a fancy term for, cartilage thinning or where of the articular cartilage, leading to early degenerative joint changes.

00:38:05:19 - 00:38:41:22
Speaker 3
Some of the athletes I've seen have shown dramatic arthritic changes within five years because they're high profile athletes. That's their job. So even though they're meniscal deficient, they still go back to playing NFL, NHL or MLB and because of that, they're at a higher risk. So their risk factors of having a degenerative knee escalate tenfold, depending on what he does, I think at the time, we saw him, he may have been a, driver for, DoorDash, but it depends on what his recreational activities are.

00:38:41:22 - 00:38:57:07
Speaker 3
If he is a high flier with recreational activity, softball, basketball, volleyball, he's going to increase his degenerative changes. Once again, 2 or 3.

00:38:57:09 - 00:39:03:19
Speaker 2
Do you have an opinion as to whether you would expect future surgical intervention for Brandon's rejection?

00:39:03:21 - 00:39:06:12
Speaker 1
Sorry.

00:39:06:14 - 00:39:08:09
Speaker 3
So, knowing what I know.

00:39:08:11 - 00:39:09:08
Speaker 2
Let me answer again.

00:39:09:13 - 00:39:12:01
Speaker 3
Okay.

00:39:12:03 - 00:39:22:16
Speaker 2
Doctor, do you have an opinion as to whether you would expect future surgical intervention on the right knee of Brandon as he gets older?

00:39:22:18 - 00:39:25:14
Speaker 1
Docs outside the scope of the reports. And go ahead, doctor.

00:39:25:16 - 00:39:55:15
Speaker 3
Okay, so it's my professional opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Mr. Page will need future surgical intervention, whether that be joint resurfacing, as a minimally invasive procedure. And or total knee replacement arthroplasty, because being that much meniscal deficiency, his knee is going to get wiped out. And I can tell you that his knee is going to be wiped out within 20 years.

00:39:55:17 - 00:40:04:05
Speaker 2
That's a based on that. Brandon may expect to get a knee replacement in his 50s.

00:40:04:07 - 00:40:23:01
Speaker 3
Well, let's hope not. I mean, we try and keep him there. It's happened. So let me let me throw this out at you. I say to my residents when I'm teaching them, I say, see all those total knee replacements on the surgical board right there? And, say and they'll look at me go, yeah, doctor McLaren, I see there's about ten knee replacements on the board for surgery today.

00:40:23:01 - 00:40:41:13
Speaker 3
I said, look at the ages. Look at the ages. 175 he said once, 56 and said, why would a 56 year old need that knee replacement right now? And they look at me and I say, remember the paper I gave you a meniscal deficiency? Where do you think those total knees come from? So that's it. So I mean, we hope not.

00:40:41:13 - 00:41:03:24
Speaker 3
But is it a is it a fact. Yeah. I mean, those 50 year olds that are getting totally replacements every day at Tampa General and every other hospital, they've had a traumatic event in their younger years because degenerative knees just don't pop up and happen. And if you're that bad to have a total knee replacement in your 50s, you had an antecedent event happened to you in your 20s or 30s.

00:41:04:04 - 00:41:14:00
Speaker 3
Unfortunately, some of them happened when they're in. They're teenagers. They had a meniscal tear as a teenager playing sports, and now they have a total knee coming in their 50s.

00:41:14:02 - 00:41:18:21
Speaker 2
As to a knee replacement, what what does that surgery entail.

00:41:18:23 - 00:41:21:01
Speaker 1
So action outside the scope of the report.

00:41:21:03 - 00:41:38:13
Speaker 3
So I don't do them I have done them. It's been 20 years since I've done them. But I mean, it's a large incision down the center of the knee. You basically resect parts of the knee and you replace them with metal and plastic. From a layman's perspective.

00:41:38:15 - 00:41:45:02
Speaker 2
Is a need for a knee replacement at an earlier age common when someone has sustained injuries, such as brand. Yes.

00:41:45:02 - 00:41:53:05
Speaker 1
Objection. Outside the scope of the report. Doctor, can you go ahead and answer it again? Just that way the records clearly go.

00:41:53:07 - 00:41:59:11
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:41:59:13 - 00:42:15:02
Speaker 2
Doctor, let's assume Brandon won't need a knee replacement in the future. You were describing some other, I guess, less invasive procedure, and I can't recall exactly what you said. But but what is that? And can you describe it?

00:42:15:04 - 00:42:18:05
Speaker 1
Jackson, outside the scope of the report, you can go ahead.

00:42:18:07 - 00:42:40:09
Speaker 3
Sure. So I'm a sports med surgeon and I'm not a total knee surgeon. So I'm the guy who offers everything but knee replacement surgery until it's necessary. So when someone's in that in-between or category where it's painful, painful, but it's not bad enough that you want to do a knee replacement, I offer three things, right. So the first thing we offer is this go supplementation.

00:42:40:09 - 00:43:00:15
Speaker 3
It's like an oil change of the knee. It's called the gel injection. You probably heard of the gel. Someone might have been talking about it. Yeah. They put the gel in my knee. So it's a gel injection. It's basically the same components. Cartilage is made out of hyaluronic acid, conduit and sulfate. We inject that. The second additive to that is called platelet rich plasma.

00:43:00:15 - 00:43:20:22
Speaker 3
You've probably heard of all the athletes in the NFL. They go and get PRP injections PRP here. Tiger Woods at PRP. Kobe Bryant used to get PRP all the time. But what it is is we draw your blood, we spin it down, we take the healing factors in your blood. We inject that into the knee. There's 3500 studies on the knee and PRP out there.

00:43:20:22 - 00:43:45:21
Speaker 3
And it's the heavy lifter of knee pain and pathology, meaning that it works as an analgesic to knee pain. And it also acts as a slow down to under arthritic changes. That's been proven on level one studies. The third modality is new, and it's been approved by Medicare and Medicaid. CMS. It's called fractionated adipose tissue. They take a small piece of adipose tissue from your abdomen.

00:43:45:21 - 00:44:16:20
Speaker 3
They fractionated, meaning they take some of the cells that are healing factor cells and inject that into the knee. It has been shown in level one studies to once again slow down the progression of arthritic changes, decrease the pain, and increase the, functionality of the knee. Those are the three biologics that I would offer. A fourth modality, which I don't think, is necessary at the time, but you can do a cartilage grafting, arthroscopic.

00:44:16:23 - 00:44:35:21
Speaker 3
You can put a camera in the knee and you can find the divots and the defects, and then you can graft it with a new cartilage paste that we have out on the market. And you can graph the defects with that. And hopefully that will work in my hands. Have only done a handful of them maybe to and they're out there.

00:44:35:21 - 00:44:55:18
Speaker 3
People are doing them. There are cartilage grafting technique. They have a bunch of different names to them. One's called de novo. The other one is called, what is that one called? No. Used to be called Curtis Cell. It's basically a cartilage grafting technique where you fill in the defects, for layman's terms and for the jury, it's like filling a pothole.

00:44:55:20 - 00:45:09:15
Speaker 3
Potholes that are in the knee, and you fill it with the cartilage. Compounds, those that should be the precursors to anything. And that's what I would do as a sports surgeon, as opposed to a total knee surgeon.

00:45:09:17 - 00:45:18:01
Speaker 3
But once again, the disclaimer on those is you have to fit the category. You can't have a wipe out arthritic knee and expect those to work.

00:45:18:03 - 00:45:22:05
Speaker 2
Would you expect Brandon to fit the category down the road in his 50?

00:45:22:05 - 00:45:43:20
Speaker 3
I, I if he came to see me in his 40s, I would offer those four modalities. I just remember the last one's called auto cart. An auto part as in autologous cartilage. Meaning we're using your own cartilage that we're salvaging. I'm sorry. We're harvesting, and we're replacing it. Robbing Peter to pay Paul, replacing it in the areas of defect.

00:45:43:20 - 00:45:53:11
Speaker 3
So those four modalities, I would definitely offer someone in their 40s, early 50s as a sport surgeon.

00:45:53:13 - 00:45:57:09
Speaker 2
Doctor, as all the treatment you've rendered. Brandon Paige been reasonable?

00:45:57:11 - 00:45:58:19
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:45:58:21 - 00:46:02:05
Speaker 2
There's all that treatment that you've rendered to Brandon Paige been necessary?

00:46:02:07 - 00:46:03:18
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:46:03:20 - 00:46:11:21
Speaker 2
And last question, doctor, have all your opinions you've given a been more likely than not within a reasonable degree of medical certainty and probability?

00:46:11:23 - 00:46:13:02
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:46:13:04 - 00:46:16:00
Speaker 2
Thank you. Doctor.

00:46:16:02 - 00:46:32:08
Speaker 1
That's all clear. And I have some follow up questions for you. My understanding, based on the testimony you just gave, is that your only knowledge about the circle K incident is that Mr. Paige suffered a slip and fall, due to water on the floor. Is that right?

00:46:32:10 - 00:46:37:06
Speaker 3
Correct.

00:46:37:08 - 00:46:47:23
Speaker 1
You did not get any history from Mr. Page of this loading and twisting of the knee occurring in this fall. Isn't that true?

00:46:48:00 - 00:46:56:20
Speaker 3
Mr. Paige stated.

00:46:56:22 - 00:47:06:22
Speaker 3
Looking through the initial evals, No, he does not describe the mechanism of his injury.

00:47:06:24 - 00:47:11:02
Speaker 1
And did you have an opportunity to review his deposition transcript?

00:47:11:04 - 00:47:12:16
Speaker 3
I did not.

00:47:12:18 - 00:47:22:06
Speaker 1
Are you aware that in the deposition transcript he indicated that he slipped and he slipped and fell onto his back? Are you aware of that?

00:47:22:08 - 00:47:33:14
Speaker 3
I saw that in one of the notes, but I did not read his deposition. But I think it says initial eval. The patient felt impacted his back.

00:47:33:16 - 00:47:43:06
Speaker 1
So as we sit here today, you have no evidence to give this jury that Mr. Page suffered a load and twist, injury to his knee and the fall in circle K? Isn't that true.

00:47:43:08 - 00:48:12:22
Speaker 3
Or. No, that's not true. The evidence I have is seeing a split horizontal cleavage tear with a displaced fragment. That can only happen from a twisting injury to the knee. So, intuitively, as an educated individual, I'm thinking, I mean, you know, you don't slip on the water and go on your back. You slip on the water, twist your knee, then you go on your back because there has to be there has to be a mechanism that goes through the knee in order for you to go to ground.

00:48:12:24 - 00:48:14:14
Speaker 1
Mr. page could have.

00:48:14:16 - 00:48:39:03
Speaker 3
Hit someone like, I'm a sports medicine guy, right? I spent a lot of my time on the sidelines and someone says, that guy took a hit up top to the shoulder and then flew in the air and landed on his back. Well, his back hurt, but his shoulder was dislocated. So it's the cause and the effect. So it's not the fact that he fell on his back, it's the fact that he twisted his knee, then slipped, then fell on his back.

00:48:39:05 - 00:48:47:20
Speaker 1
But Mr. Page could have suffered a twisting injury to his knee in some place or some other form other than the fall at circle K, isn't that right for me?

00:48:47:22 - 00:49:02:08
Speaker 3
Well, maybe, but I'll be honest. There's no way you walked around with that knee like that prior to that. Even if he injured that knee prior to the circle K and he was walking around on that knee for months before that, I'd give him credit because that's a horrible meniscus tear.

00:49:02:10 - 00:49:14:11
Speaker 1
Well, that's actually interesting that you bring that up because isn't it true that Mr. Page's first treatment for right knee complaints was that complete care on August 14th, 2020, two and a half months after the fall in circle K, occurred?

00:49:14:13 - 00:49:17:08
Speaker 3
That is this first visit correct?

00:49:17:10 - 00:49:28:08
Speaker 1
And isn't it true, then, that after you saw him on October 19th, 2020, Mr. Page then waited at least another six months before undergoing the surgery in March of 2021?

00:49:28:10 - 00:49:45:24
Speaker 3
Correct. But the patients are not, able to just say it's not like fast food. They can't say, hey, let's have my surgery next week. So there's a process. And so that does not surprise me that the process took that, particularly in the world of personal injury and legal.

00:49:46:01 - 00:49:59:20
Speaker 1
Well, in total, Mr. Page was able to continue walking on his knee for a total of ten months from the time of this alleged fall in circle K June 6th, 2020, until he underwent surgery with you on March 30th, 2021. Isn't that right?

00:49:59:22 - 00:50:09:08
Speaker 3
He might have been walking, but wasn't he symptomatic the whole time? According to the records, he was with the seven out of ten on a pain scale the entire time, affecting his activities of living.

00:50:09:10 - 00:50:23:17
Speaker 1
And according to the history provided to you by Mr. Page, as documented in your medical records and as documented in his sworn deposition testimony, he not once gave a history of twisting his knee in the fall in circle K. Isn't that right?

00:50:23:19 - 00:50:39:16
Speaker 3
I don't have it documented, but once again, I'm going to say intuitively, as an educated orthopedic surgeon who teaches this and I teach mechanisms of injury, and I've lectured nationally internationally on knee meniscus injuries, that's the only way that can happen.

00:50:39:18 - 00:50:48:23
Speaker 1
Are you aware that, Mr. Page used to be involved in, what he referred to as MMA? Mixed martial art?

00:50:49:00 - 00:50:50:05
Speaker 3
I am not.

00:50:50:07 - 00:50:53:20
Speaker 1
Okay. And what are you familiar with? Mixed martial arts.

00:50:53:22 - 00:51:03:04
Speaker 3
I was the team physician for mixed martial arts. Bellator for seven years. While I had the D1 Sports Med Center.

00:51:03:06 - 00:51:12:06
Speaker 1
And when you're performing the maneuvers and mixed martial arts, could you have twisted or rotated your knee?

00:51:12:08 - 00:51:14:17
Speaker 3
Yes.

00:51:14:19 - 00:51:21:09
Speaker 1
Are you aware that Mr. Page is a long distance runner before the fall at circle K in June 2020?

00:51:21:11 - 00:51:24:21
Speaker 3
It's not in the records, but if you tell me that, I would believe it.

00:51:24:23 - 00:51:30:06
Speaker 1
Does long distance running increase the stress on people's knees?

00:51:30:08 - 00:51:42:07
Speaker 3
There's not any papers out there that show that long distance running is inhibited or precursor to meniscal injury.

00:51:42:09 - 00:51:47:17
Speaker 1
Are you aware that Mr. Page is six feet, four inches tall and weighs 270 pounds?

00:51:47:19 - 00:51:51:00
Speaker 3
That is what is written in his medical records.

00:51:51:02 - 00:51:56:00
Speaker 1
Does height and weight play any role in increasing stress in the knees?

00:51:56:02 - 00:52:11:00
Speaker 3
That's a great question because that's one of my resident debates. There is not any paper out there that shows that body habitus or body morphology shows any, direct correlation to increased incidence of injury to the knee.

00:52:11:02 - 00:52:24:23
Speaker 1
So it's I didn't talk about injury, I just talking about stress on the knees. That's your testimony then to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Page, being 270 pounds, plays no role in wear and tear or stress on his knees.

00:52:25:00 - 00:52:35:23
Speaker 3
That is correct. And I look at it as I have NFL linemen in my practice that are that same size that do not have any pathology to their knee after a career of 5 to 10 years.

00:52:36:00 - 00:52:48:02
Speaker 1
And likewise, it's your testimony to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that Mr. Page will not have any increased stress or wear and tear on his knees because of long distance running.

00:52:48:04 - 00:53:02:05
Speaker 3
He will not have any increase. If he had a normal knee, he will have an increase now because he's 40% meniscal deficient. So running a normal guy? No. Running an abnormal deficient guy. Yes.

00:53:02:07 - 00:53:11:07
Speaker 1
And speaking of abnormal Minnesota, you're aware, of course, that Mr. Page had a meniscal tear in the other knee, the left knee back in 2012?

00:53:11:09 - 00:53:14:02
Speaker 3
That is in his records, correct. That he stated.

00:53:14:04 - 00:53:19:06
Speaker 1
And you did not review any MRI or operative reports following that injury. Correct.

00:53:19:08 - 00:53:24:21
Speaker 3
We did ask for them. He had no records and nothing to share with us.

00:53:24:23 - 00:53:34:07
Speaker 1
Okay. Are you aware that Mr. Page testified under oath at his deposition, that he suffered a meniscal tear in 2012? Not because of any particular trauma, but just because of wear and tear?

00:53:34:09 - 00:53:38:11
Speaker 3
I did not review his deposition.

00:53:38:13 - 00:53:43:21
Speaker 1
And that 2012 meniscal tear required surgery. You're aware of that, right?

00:53:43:23 - 00:53:46:06
Speaker 3
Yes, ma'am.

00:53:46:08 - 00:53:49:15
Speaker 1
Not every meniscal tear require surgery, is that right?

00:53:49:17 - 00:53:51:22
Speaker 3
That is correct.

00:53:51:24 - 00:54:01:14
Speaker 1
But in this particular case with Mr. Page, after ten months following the fall in circle K, you did do surgery in March 2021, correct?

00:54:01:16 - 00:54:02:13
Speaker 3
Correct.

00:54:02:15 - 00:54:05:02
Speaker 1
And he had a good result from that surgery.

00:54:05:04 - 00:54:09:03
Speaker 3
To the best of my knowledge and what we have discussed. Yes.

00:54:09:05 - 00:54:13:13
Speaker 1
You referred him to physical therapy following a surgical procedure. Correct?

00:54:13:15 - 00:54:14:21
Speaker 3
Correct.

00:54:14:23 - 00:54:21:20
Speaker 1
And isn't it true that he was discharged from physical therapy because he was not returning to the therapy appointments?

00:54:21:22 - 00:54:26:07
Speaker 3
I do not have that knowledge.

00:54:26:09 - 00:54:36:04
Speaker 1
Isn't it also true that Mr. Page failed to appear at two follow up visits? A complete Care on June 1st, 2021 and June 16th, 2021?

00:54:36:06 - 00:54:43:24
Speaker 3
To the best of my knowledge, he did not follow up as scheduled after his first post-op visit. For 13 of 21.

00:54:44:01 - 00:54:51:22
Speaker 1
So no one at Complete Care has seen Mr. Page related to his knee since April of 2021. Correct?

00:54:51:24 - 00:54:53:10
Speaker 3
Correct.

00:54:53:12 - 00:54:58:19
Speaker 1
And so you're not aware of his current medical condition as it relates to the right knee?

00:54:58:21 - 00:55:04:16
Speaker 3
Not other than what I've read in his post-op report for 13 of 2021.

00:55:04:18 - 00:55:11:22
Speaker 1
And you are not aware of his current, daily activities or hobbies or sports that he's participating in.

00:55:11:24 - 00:55:13:20
Speaker 3
I am not.

00:55:13:22 - 00:55:34:06
Speaker 1
And I think you called it earlier, a quote, lean and moment for the jury. When you were talking about the condition that he may suffer from in the future. So going back to that lean and moment, you then have not seen Mr. Page since early 2021 and you have no idea about his current medical condition.

00:55:34:08 - 00:55:36:00
Speaker 1
Is that right?

00:55:36:02 - 00:55:59:20
Speaker 3
That is correct. But what you're talking about is incorrect. The lean in moment is the definition of meniscal deficiency, not Mr. Page's condition. It's the definition of him being 40% meniscal deficient, has a 100% chance of him having a degenerative knee in the next 20 years, and that's well documented in multiple level one study papers throughout the orthopedic literature.

00:55:59:22 - 00:56:00:13
Speaker 3
That's the leader.

00:56:00:13 - 00:56:16:21
Speaker 1
Do you'll agree with me that despite the lean and moment that he'll have a 100% chance of having degeneration, you have no idea whether or not Mr. Page would ever undergo any of the procedures that you've laid out for the jury today, right?

00:56:16:23 - 00:56:18:22
Speaker 3
I do not I have not seen him.

00:56:18:24 - 00:56:32:06
Speaker 1
And in fact, on that same subject of having no idea what he's going to undergo in the future, he didn't even didn't even complete the post-operative recommendations that you gave him back in 2021. Right?

00:56:32:08 - 00:56:44:11
Speaker 3
It appears so.

00:56:44:13 - 00:56:47:17
Speaker 1
All right. I don't have any other questions for you. Thank you so much, doctor McLaren.

00:56:47:19 - 00:56:51:10
Speaker 3
You're welcome.

00:56:51:12 - 00:57:13:04
Speaker 2
Doctor, just a few questions. You've mentioned meniscal deficiency, and you diagnosed, Brandon Page with, a municipal deficiency, correct? Correct. And is that because he has only 60% of his meniscus at this time, after the surgery.

00:57:13:06 - 00:57:22:11
Speaker 3
On his medial side, being the inside part of his knee, he is currently has a repaired 60% left of his medial meniscus.

00:57:22:13 - 00:57:24:24
Speaker 2
So 40% of that is gone.

00:57:25:01 - 00:57:27:09
Speaker 3
Gone and never coming back.

00:57:27:11 - 00:57:35:13
Speaker 2
And the reason why 40% of that is gone is is it because he, sustained an acute injury?

00:57:35:15 - 00:57:36:16
Speaker 3
Correct.

00:57:36:18 - 00:58:15:19
Speaker 2
And you had testified earlier that this acute injury that you identified from reviewing the records during a physical examination of Brandon Page, looking at the MRI eyes and talking to him that, he. Has meniscus deficiency was a, I'm sorry I lost my train of thought. All right, let's.

00:58:15:21 - 00:58:19:08
Speaker 2
Doctor, you testified that.

00:58:19:10 - 00:58:26:08
Speaker 2
You diagnosed with a meniscal deficiency and that he had lost 40% of that portion of his meniscus, correct?

00:58:26:10 - 00:58:27:04
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:58:27:06 - 00:58:34:21
Speaker 2
And that the, deficiency is because of the surgery that you performed where you had to remove portion of it, correct?

00:58:34:23 - 00:58:35:10
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:58:35:11 - 00:58:37:15
Speaker 2
And that portion was 40%.

00:58:37:17 - 00:58:38:15
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:58:38:17 - 00:58:44:09
Speaker 2
And the reason why you perform that, surgery was due to an acute injury, correct?

00:58:44:11 - 00:58:45:10
Speaker 3
Yes, sir.

00:58:45:12 - 00:58:59:11
Speaker 2
And this is where I was going. As far as the acute injury you identify, this acute injury is, in an injury. That's that occurs because of it. We're seeing knee type fall.

00:58:59:13 - 00:59:00:16
Speaker 3
That is.

00:59:00:18 - 00:59:03:08
Speaker 2
I suppose, is what you. I think you testified to.

00:59:03:10 - 00:59:32:03
Speaker 3
Correct the configuration I showed you, as I showed you before, with a horizontal split tear with a piece that's fragmented out, can only happen with a twisting tape. And and what we call a shearing mechanism. It's got a shear that meniscus in a twisting type. It. When Mr. Verona alluded to the fact that there are some that are not, operative versus some that are operative, if you have a radial tear that we call non displaced.

00:59:32:03 - 00:59:48:20
Speaker 3
So it's non displaced. It's not moving. It's not doing anything. You can leave those alone. And and they'll be fine. The ones that are displaced that have a piece a chunk of it torn off and flipped over into the joint. There's no alternative. You have to you have to take care of that. You have to surgically remove and repair that.

00:59:48:22 - 00:59:54:06
Speaker 2
And what you were just describing, that's what you were showing in the pictures earlier in this deposition. Correct?

00:59:54:08 - 01:00:17:01
Speaker 3
Correct. They showed it as, a black and white piece. And you can actually see, I mean, this is a it's a beautiful image. Bad for him, but good for the image. This is a piece that that whole chunk, that whole 40% piece is flipped over on itself and sitting in the middle of his joint right there. I mean, that's that's a dead piece of tissue, but it's still causing symptoms.

01:00:17:01 - 01:00:28:20
Speaker 3
And so that has to go. And then the rest of it we have to repair to prevent this from going from 60% left to 20% left.

01:00:28:22 - 01:00:36:04
Speaker 2
And those injuries that you were just showing us on the picture,

01:00:36:06 - 01:00:48:03
Speaker 2
Could those injuries be caused by a twisting, knee event as you fall backwards? Yes. Can you twist your knee falling backwards?

01:00:48:05 - 01:00:50:11
Speaker 3
Yes.

01:00:50:13 - 01:00:53:20
Speaker 2
Is that a common way to twist your knee?

01:00:53:22 - 01:01:01:18
Speaker 3
Most of the time I see someone fall. They have a knee injury to it because there's a twisting mechanism going on with the knee.

01:01:01:20 - 01:01:10:06
Speaker 2
Would you kind of describe that as, a poor, a poor splits, type mechanism?

01:01:10:08 - 01:01:22:21
Speaker 3
I would just describe it as a torsion or a shear force mechanism.

01:01:22:23 - 01:01:32:18
Speaker 2
As far as the recovery from the surgery that you performed, well, younger person generally recover faster.

01:01:32:20 - 01:01:37:13
Speaker 1
Sectional type. Sorry, outside the scope of direct or, cross.

01:01:37:15 - 01:01:58:07
Speaker 3
And I can't say that because you can have a young, unhealthy person versus a 55 year old super fit person, and the super fit, healthy person is at 55 is going to heal better. It just depends on your fitness level. It depends on your motivation, it depends on your genetics. And so I can't really put that in a box and say that, okay.

01:01:58:09 - 01:02:13:13
Speaker 2
All right, doctor, that's all the questions I have for you.

01:02:13:15 - 01:02:21:00
Speaker 1
And the questions. Okay. This is a reader always,

01:02:21:02 - 01:02:24:22
Speaker 2
I'm sorry. Well, doctor, do you want to waive or read?

01:02:24:24 - 01:02:25:22
Speaker 3
Oh, wait.

01:02:25:24 - 01:02:29:02
Speaker 1
Yeah, it's for trial, so he doesn't. Yeah. Doesn't do that.

01:02:29:04 - 01:02:35:17
Speaker 2
Yeah. Sorry, I, I didn't know you, but I couldn't hear you. And I lost my train of thought because of my chicken scratch on this page.

01:02:35:19 - 01:02:40:17
Speaker 1
Oh, listen, it happens to all of us. That's why I was, like, laughing. Because I'm like. That's when you just got to be like, okay, just start this whole thing.

01:02:40:17 - 01:02:43:20
Speaker 2
Yeah. It started over the that's part of the video. I can just start it over.

01:02:43:23 - 01:02:47:10
Speaker 3
But just do it over, okay. Are we.

01:02:47:10 - 01:02:48:06
Speaker 1
Ready to go off the.

01:02:48:06 - 01:02:50:15
Speaker 3
Record. Oh we're not. Yes. Oh my gosh.

01:02:50:19 - 01:02:56:24
Speaker 1
No sorry okay. We are off the record. The time is 2:10 p.m.. This concludes the deposition. We'll.
