        05           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Good afternoon.  We are on
        06      the record.  The time is 1:08 p.m. on
        07      November 13th of 2025.  Private conversations and/or
        08      attorney/client interactions should be held outside
        09      the presence of the remote interface.  For the
        10      purpose of creating a witness-only video recording,
        11      the witness is being spotlighted or locked on all
        12      video screens while in speaker view.  We ask that
        13      the witness not remove the spotlight setting during
        14      the deposition, as it may cause other participants
        15      to appear on the final video rather than just the
        16      witness.  For anyone who does not want the witness'
        17      video to take up the large part of your screen, you

        23      is being held remotely.  My name is Leah Mendez.
        24      I'm the videographer on behalf of
        25      U.S. Legal Support.  I am not related to any party
  00005:01      in this action, nor am I financially interested in
        02      the outcome.  The court reporter is Brianna Williams
        03      on behalf of U.S. Legal Support.  Counsel will state
        04      their appearances for the record, after which the
        05      court reporter will enter the statement for remote
        06      proceedings and swear in the witness.
        07           MR. BEATTIE:  Kelly Beattie on behalf of the

        10      defendant Circle K Stores.
        11           THE REPORTER:  Do you solemnly swear that the
        12      testimony you're about to give shall be the truth,
        13      the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help
        14      you God?
        15           THE WITNESS:  I do.
        16  THEREUPON,
        17                 DR. M. CHRISTOPHER MACLAREN
        18  having first been duly sworn, was examined and testified
        19  as follows:
        20                     DIRECT EXAMINATION
        21  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        22      Q.   Good afternoon, Doctor.
        23           Could you please introduce yourself to the
        24  jury?
        25      A.   Sure.  Dr. M. Christopher MacLaren, D.O.,
  00006:01  Fellow of American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.
        02      Q.   And what type of doctor are you?
        03      A.   So I am a dual-board-certified orthopedic
        04  surgeon.  I have a certification in orthopedic surgery
        05  where I did a military Army trauma postgraduate
        06  fellowship training.  And I also am board certified as a
        07  sports medicine orthopedic surgeon, which means that I
        08  am dual board certified and I perform arthroscopy and
        09  sports medicine surgery on extremities.  It's limited to
        10  extremity work.  I do not do spine or hand surgery.
        11      Q.   Okay.  So -- and I'm -- and I'm sure a lot of
        12  the jury knows exactly what that is, what -- an
        13  orthopedic surgeon, but if you could explain in general
        14  terms what that means to be that type of doctor.  You
        15  were explaining extremities and --
        16      A.   Yeah.
        17      Q.   -- arthroscopy.
        18           Can you explain that in a little greater
        19  detail, please, for the jury?
        20      A.   Sure.  So an orthopedic surgeon basically is a
        21  surgeon of the musculoskeletal system.  So it ranges
        22  from anything from broken bones, torn muscles, torn
        23  ligaments, torn tendons.  Layman's terms, if you see
        24  someone with a fractured wrist or a fractured ankle,
        25  that's what an orthopedic surgeon would then take care
  00007:01  of, if you go through the emergency department for
        02  soft-tissue injuries, such as a torn muscle or a torn
        03  Achilles.  You're watching a football game.  You see
        04  someone tear their knee up and they go through the
        05  orthopedic surgeon department.  Then they have a
        06  ligament surgery done, a reconstructive surgery.  So
        07  we're basically human mechanics.  We -- we fix all of
        08  the bones and soft-tissue structures of the body.
        09      Q.   Thank you, Doctor.
        10           And could you give the jury the benefit of your
        11  educational background, please?
        12      A.   So I graduated with honors cum laude from the
        13  Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.  I went on to
        14  go to medical school at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio,
        15  where I graduated number one in my class, political
        16  science.  I then went on to perform an orthopedic
        17  surgery residency at Oklahoma State University in
        18  Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I was awarded chief residency honors.
        19  And with that, I scored on my written orthopedic surgery
        20  boards 96 percent; my oral, 95 percent; my clinical
        21  boards, 95 percent.  So with that, I was invited to
        22  become a board examiner.
        23           After my residency, I did postgraduate
        24  fellowship training in sports medicine and arthroscopy
        25  at University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas.  And then
  00008:01  as an active-duty Army combat surgeon, I was then put
        02  into trauma surgery training at the esteemed
        03  Parkland Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, known for
        04  where Kennedy went for the assassination.
        05           I served my country for five years as an
        06  active-duty combat surgeon.  Was deployed to Afghanistan
        07  immediately after 9/11 with 101st Airborne where I
        08  served as their combat surgeon.  Throughout my combat
        09  surgery experience in Afghanistan, I was proud to say I
        10  received a coveted combat medical badge and award from
        11  General Tommy Franks for 21 combat saves in theater and,
        12  also, a meritorious service medal for combat under fire
        13  during Tora Bora during the hunt of Bin Laden.
        14           So following my military career, I served my
        15  five years.  I was honorably discharged and, during that
        16  time, was board certified and then recertified ten years
        17  later when I was in private practice.  I started private
        18  practice in Tampa, Florida.  One of the proudest things
        19  I did is -- after the military is I became a professor
        20  of orthopedic surgery.  So since 2009 at USF and at
        21  Nova Southeastern, USF being University of South Florida
        22  and Nova Southeastern, I've been able to train medical
        23  students and residents and preparing them for board
        24  certification since then.  And I've been doing private
        25  practice for now 25 years.
  00009:01      Q.   Thank you, Doctor.
        02           Can you explain to the jury what it means to be
        03  board certified?
        04      A.   So board certification is the highest standard
        05  of any surgeon or doctor's profession.  It means that
        06  you have met a higher standard of education and cases
        07  that you performed as well as done the appropriate
        08  academic curriculum.  In order to do that, you take a
        09  written examination.  Mine, at least at the time, was
        10  400 questions.  And you take an oral examination, which,
        11  at the time, mine was eight hours, where you could be
        12  asked anything from any realm of surgery, spine surgery,
        13  pediatric surgery, tumor surgery.  And once you complete
        14  those two phases, the third phase is two to three board
        15  of examiners come in and watch you operate.  They watch
        16  you operate whether they deem two or three cases.  And
        17  once that they can deem that you are qualified, then and
        18  only then do you get your board certification for the
        19  first time.  Fairly rigorous.  Usually takes two after
        20  your -- your residency is completed.
        21           Following that, to maintain your board
        22  certification, you have to take a recertification.  And
        23  that is an exam every ten years, usually 200 to 250
        24  questions on current -- keeping you current, current
        25  principles, current orthopedic practices.  And so since
  00010:01  then, I've been board certified twice in two different
        02  certifications and recertified twice and passed them
        03  all.
        04      Q.   And so aside from your education -- now we're
        05  in your work life.
        06           Who do you currently work for and -- and for
        07  how long?
        08      A.   So currently I work for Complete Care Centers.
        09  I am a 1099 hired consultant.  I started with them
        10  August of 2018.
        11      Q.   And in your role at Complete Care, you're a
        12  board-certified surgeon is what I'm understanding and --
        13      A.   Yes, sir.
        14      Q.   -- specialize in orthopedic trauma and fracture
        15  care?
        16      A.   Trauma; fracture care; and sports medicine
        17  surgery, which is minimally-invasive surgery of the
        18  extremities, shoulder, elbow, and knee.
        19      Q.   And you're the medical director at this
        20  facility?
        21      A.   Yes, sir.
        22      Q.   And what -- what do those duties entail as a
        23  medical director?
        24      A.   So they entail -- I oversee the four what we
        25  call medical hubs.  What that means is the medical hubs
  00011:01  contain the specialists, spine surgeons, extremity
        02  surgeons, pain management/interventional spine surgeons,
        03  neurologists, basically the -- the clinical surgical
        04  specialties.  So I oversee those and I do chart audits
        05  and I do -- basically answer all questions from all of
        06  our mid-level providers.  They have open access to ask
        07  me questions on MRI reviews, patient care.  So I oversee
        08  the mid-level providers.
        09           My next hat I wear is education.  So I do all
        10  of the educational, I guess, seminars for all of our new
        11  employees, for all of our mid-level providers, medical
        12  assistants, nurse-practitioners, physician assistants.
        13  And the last one I do is I basically oversee --
        14  basically as a fireman -- oversee any problems that may
        15  arise within providers.  If providers have issues or
        16  problems, they come to me.
        17      Q.   Okay.  And so as the medical director, fair to
        18  say that you oversee a lot of surgeries within the
        19  clinic?
        20      A.   I am the medical director for the extremities,
        21  so I oversee those.  I don't oversee any of the spine
        22  procedures.
        23      Q.   And would you oversee knee surgeries on a
        24  regular basis?
        25      A.   Yes, sir.
  00012:01      Q.   Now, Doctor, we're here with regard to one of
        02  your patients, Brandon Paige.  My co-counsel and I
        03  represent Brandon in a claim for an incident where he
        04  had slipped and fell on a wet floor entering a gas
        05  station, resulting in an injury.
        06           Is that your understanding of the incident that
        07  Brandon mentioned to you while you were treating him?
        08      A.   Yes, sir.
        09      Q.   And do you have medical records, reports, or
        10  films with you today --
        11      A.   Yes, sir.
        12      Q.   -- regarding Brandon?
        13      A.   Yes, sir.
        14      Q.   So, Doctor, if you need to refer to those at
        15  any point for your testimony today, please feel free to
        16  do so.
        17           Now, Doctor, could you please tell us exactly
        18  what you brought in terms of records and other
        19  information with respect to Brandon?
        20      A.   So I have medical records that start with a new
        21  patient intake that he had filled out.  It is filled out
        22  in his own handwriting.  It's dated 6/17/2020.  It
        23  corresponds with an initial evaluation that he had done
        24  by -- I'm trying to see who did that.  On
        25  June 23rd of 2020, he was seen for an initial eval by
  00013:01  Judith Plummer-Morgan, nurse-practitioner.  And then he
        02  was also seen before he saw me by our orthopedic
        03  physician assistant, Sam Sabello, on 8/13 of 2020.
        04           The rest of the records I have are an MRI of
        05  his right knee dated 8/27/2020.  I have my initial
        06  consultation dated 10/19/2020.  I have my operative
        07  report from Orlando Center for Outpatient Surgery dated
        08  3/30/2021.  I have a postop progress note dated
        09  4/13/2021.  And that's it.
        10      Q.   Would all those records and reports and films
        11  refresh your recollection today regarding Brandon?
        12      A.   Yes.
        13      Q.   Are the records and films and reports kept in
        14  the normal course of your business and medical practice
        15  at Complete Care?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   Were those same records and reports and films
        18  made at or near the time Brandon was being treated at
        19  Complete Care for --
        20      A.   Yes.
        21      Q.   -- his neck and knee surgeries -- oh, I'm
        22  sorry.
        23           It was neck and back and knee injuries and
        24  pain?
        25      A.   Yes.
  00014:01      Q.   And is this regular practice for your office
        02  and medical facilities where you perform surgeries to
        03  make these types of records and reports?
        04      A.   Yes.
        05      Q.   And, Doctor, I -- it's obvious.  Obviously,
        06  you -- you treated him while you were there.
        07           But at one point, you did provide care and
        08  treatment to Brandon, correct?
        09      A.   Yes, sir.
        10      Q.   And you just kind of walked through the dates
        11  with us, but it sounds like you saw him on
        12  October 19th of 2020; is that -- is that correct?
        13      A.   Yes, sir.
        14      Q.   And -- and what complaints did Brandon present
        15  to you with at your practice?
        16      A.   So Brandon stated his right knee was sharp,
        17  tight.  His knee gets stiff.  It does not radiate.  His
        18  biggest complaint was instability in the right knee.
        19  His pain radiates anywhere from two at its best to seven
        20  out of ten on its worst where ten is the worst on a pain
        21  scale.  He has pain constantly.  It's worse with
        22  walking, standing, turning, and moving.  It's improved
        23  with stretching and wearing a knee brace.  He also
        24  reports that his activities of daily living are affected
        25  including household chores, childcare, driving,
  00015:01  exercising, social activities, sleeping, occupational
        02  activities.
        03      Q.   And, Doctor, it's my understanding that you had
        04  the benefit of reviewing diagnostic imaging of Brandon's
        05  right knee; is that -- is that correct?
        06      A.   Yes, sir.
        07      Q.   And it's also my understanding you performed a
        08  physical examination of Brandon when you met him for the
        09  first time.
        10      A.   Yes, sir.
        11      Q.   And what were the findings after your consults
        12  with him and reviewing the imaging and performing the
        13  physical examinations of Brandon?
        14      A.   So the findings were he had a significant,
        15  quite large, what we call a horizontal cleavage tear of
        16  his medial meniscus that encompassed about 50 percent of
        17  the surface area of it.
        18      Q.   And I thought I had read in the op report that
        19  under the preop diagnosis and the postop diagnosis,
        20  there's a second item where it's hypertrophic synovitis
        21  right knee with a medial synovial plica band.
        22           Can you explain --
        23      A.   Right.
        24      Q.   -- to the jury what that is?
        25      A.   Yes, sir.  So whenever we have a meniscal
  00016:01  injury or an injury to the knee, the normal lining,
        02  think of it like a Saran Wrap lining inside the knee.
        03  It's called synovial lining, so it's the lining that
        04  secretes synovial fluid.  So all of our joints have
        05  fluid in it.  So hypertrophic means expanding or getting
        06  larger, hyper meaning larger.  Trophic means thickening.
        07  So it's a larger thickened synovial lining that looks,
        08  you know, like a big, thick, thick, carpet that
        09  shouldn't be in there because it should be a thin
        10  lining.  Instead, it's triple in size, quadruple in
        11  size.
        12           And a plica band is a band of tissue that runs
        13  medially and it rubs.  It's like a friction rub.  So the
        14  synovial lining gets so thick, if it's inside the knee
        15  joint and it's tripling in size, now it's rubbing on the
        16  knee area.  So that's part of the injury.  It's just
        17  basically like a swollen synovial lining.  So we see
        18  that when we put a camera in.  And once we see that, we
        19  remove it because it's -- it's causing pain and it's
        20  causing impingement.
        21      Q.   And, Doctor, you diagnosed Brandon with a
        22  complex -- a right knee complex tear of a medial
        23  meniscus?
        24      A.   Yes, sir.
        25      Q.   And then we were just talking about the second
  00017:01  diagnosis, right, with the -- the synovial -- the fluid
        02  in the knee, right?
        03      A.   The synovial lining is the thickening of the
        04  lining, the thickening of the -- the lining tissue of
        05  the knee.  Correct.
        06      Q.   As to those diagnoses, is that opinion more
        07  likely than not within a reasonable degree of medical
        08  probability and certainty?
        09      A.   Yes, sir.
        10      Q.   In layman terms, Doctor, can you just describe
        11  the nature and extent of the right knee injury that
        12  Brandon sustained?
        13      A.   Sure.  So it's a -- a twisting injury.  I'll
        14  show you -- I kind of drew it out for you guys.  I
        15  couldn't find my knee model.  But if we look at the
        16  knee, this is the inside part of the knee.  If you reach
        17  down and touch your knee on the inside part, it's called
        18  the medial side.  So what he sustained was, in this
        19  picture, he had split his meniscus cartilage.  The knee
        20  has two kinds of cartilage in it.  It's got the covering
        21  cartilage, like you see on the end of a chicken bone.
        22  And then it's got the meniscal cartilage, which are the
        23  little rubbery O-rings, because they look like O-rings,
        24  but they're washers and they have two functions.  They
        25  bumper the knee from being bone on bone and they act as
  00018:01  a cup-and-saucer stabilizer.
        02           So here's a better picture.  You can see the
        03  O-ring here.  This is on the outside, the O-ring here on
        04  the inside.  A normal medial meniscus looks like a
        05  rubbery C shape, but Brandon Paige had split his like
        06  this into a horizontal cleavage.  And then on top of
        07  that, he had a flipped piece that came flipping out like
        08  this, like a ton or kind of like a -- here it is.  It
        09  was flipping back and forth causing a painful clicking
        10  part.  And that's why we call it a complex tear because
        11  it's torn into two different planes.
        12      Q.   Doctor, did the medical records and the notes
        13  that you reviewed pertaining to Brandon indicate that
        14  the incident he reported to his doctors, including you,
        15  was the slip and fall on a wet floor entering a gas
        16  station on June 6th of 2020?
        17      A.   That's correct.
        18      Q.   And do you have an opinion as to what caused
        19  the diagnosis that you came up with?
        20      A.   So the configuration that you see there that I
        21  drew out is a horizontal cleavage tear and that can't
        22  happen without a traumatic event.  So that's a
        23  bottle-cap effect or a twisting effect.  I wish I had my
        24  knee model.  But if you think of the knee this way like
        25  I drew on the picture, when you twist the knee like
  00019:01  that, it tears that meniscus because it's a shear force.
        02  So in light of the fact that at thirty -- let's see.
        03  31 years old?  31 years old.  He has no degenerative
        04  changes, no arthritic changes, no degenerative meniscus.
        05  He has nothing that precludes him from having any kind
        06  of arthritic changes in his knee and we can see that on
        07  the pictures that I took.  And the only way to have a
        08  split horizontal tear like that with a displaced
        09  fragment is to have a traumatic event to that knee.  So
        10  the traumatic event is a load and twist, like a bottle
        11  cap twisting.
        12      Q.   Is that opinion more likely than not within a
        13  within a reasonable degree of medical probability and
        14  certainty?
        15      A.   Yes, sir.
        16      Q.   And, Doctor, are you aware of any injury to
        17  Brandon's right knee prior to this incident on 6/6/20?
        18      A.   No.  He stated he had a left knee meniscus
        19  repair in 2012 that he stated he did not have any injury
        20  to the right knee prior.
        21      Q.   Doctor, I want to talk about the treatment and
        22  the surgery that you provided -- or Brandon.
        23           Is the goal of your treatment that you provided
        24  Brandon to relieve pain and maximize function?
        25      A.   Yes, sir.
  00020:01      Q.   And sometimes to accomplish that, does that
        02  include surgical intervention?
        03      A.   Yes, sir.  For -- for his injury and his size
        04  tear, there was not a lot of options.  He was just going
        05  to proceed -- or progressively get worse with the
        06  configuration of this tear.  If you don't repair this,
        07  you're going to lose almost all of your meniscus
        08  cartilage over the next year or two.
        09      Q.   So Brandon needed this surgery to relieve the
        10  pain in his knee, repair it, and maximize function; is
        11  that fair?
        12      A.   Yes.  And I would also add to preserve the
        13  knee's condition.  So what I mean by that is when we
        14  repair a meniscus, we're preventing that meniscus from
        15  future retear.  We're also preventing that meniscus from
        16  not functioning correctly.  So the key wording we use
        17  now in the academy of orthopedic sports medicine is
        18  joint preservation techniques.  So truly, it's not now
        19  that he'll reap the benefit of that joint preservation,
        20  but it's 10, 15 years from now where we have saved that
        21  meniscus and, thus, keeping the mechanics of the knee
        22  from getting early degenerative osteoarthritic
        23  conditions.  Not saying that he won't, but at least
        24  we're giving it a fighting chance.
        25      Q.   So moving into the -- the treatments, the
  00021:01  surgery.  I -- I kind of broke them out into four
        02  categories because that's kind of how the op report
        03  set -- set forth the -- the procedures that were
        04  performed.  The first one was -- I'm reading a right
        05  knee arthroscopy.
        06           Can you explain to us what that is?
        07      A.   Correct.  So arthroscopy, just like what's
        08  drawn on this picture, is basically taking a little
        09  camera about the size of this pen on the end, taking a
        10  little camera and making one small poke hole and putting
        11  it right here and then taking an instrument with the
        12  same poke hole and putting another little poke hole.
        13  And you can see everything in the knee with that camera
        14  and you can repair things.  You can visualize things
        15  very well.  Even though these are black and white, I
        16  think you can all see it.
        17           So this is what it -- what I'm -- I'd be
        18  looking at.  I'd be looking inside his knee with the
        19  camera.  And then you can see here on this picture --
        20  that's a great picture.  That's the horizontal cleavage
        21  split tear I was talking about.  You can see where his
        22  meniscus is split all the way.  And then this piece
        23  right here is a free fragment.  See how it pops in and
        24  out like a -- kind of a jack-in-the-box.  It's popping
        25  back and forth and that's what's giving him all of
  00022:01  that -- that incessant pain.  It's like a car hood
        02  flipping over on itself.  So these are -- even though
        03  they're black and white -- the color photos are great,
        04  but if you see the black and white, you can kind of see
        05  it from there.
        06           So this is what I'm seeing with a tiny incision
        07  and then I could fix things with mini instruments
        08  through the knee there.  Oh.  Here's a great picture.
        09  Here's that little jack-in-the-box piece I was talking
        10  about.  It's not really a technical term, but you can
        11  see here this whole fragment has popped back out from
        12  where his knee was torn.  There's the horizontal piece,
        13  but look how large this piece was where it flipped.  And
        14  it's in the -- in between his two joint, the -- the part
        15  of his joint, so this is -- this is a menace right here.
        16      Q.   And that menace is what was causing him pain,
        17  in your opinion?
        18      A.   Pain and instability.  Correct.  That was
        19  the -- that was the -- the main generator of pain and
        20  instability and swelling.
        21      Q.   So moving on to the second line item and the
        22  procedures performed.
        23           I'm -- I'm reading:  Right knee medial meniscus
        24  repair using a suture anchor.
        25           Now --
  00023:01      A.   Right.
        02      Q.   -- is that -- is that addressing the -- those
        03  tears that you were just describing on the picture?
        04      A.   Correct.  So this is a kind of a two phase.  So
        05  the first phase is this piece is dead.  I mean, this
        06  cartilage flap, this -- this chunky piece that's
        07  flipping back and forth, you can't repair that.  It's a
        08  dead piece of tissue.  So that gets resected.  That gets
        09  removed.
        10           And then the rest of the meniscus right here
        11  where the split tear is, this is where I would insert a
        12  meniscal repair anchor.  And you can't see it great
        13  here, but there's a suture that repairs this.  And what
        14  that does is it prevents that horizontal cleavage tear
        15  from propagating.  It prevents it from getting bigger.
        16  And it actually -- it actually stabilizes it.  So we've
        17  done two things.  We've removed the bad part because we
        18  can't do anything with it and then we've repaired the
        19  good stuff that's left.
        20      Q.   And then moving on to the third line item.
        21  This is going to be a struggle for me to pronounce, but
        22  I'll do my best.
        23           Two-compartment synovectomy with excision of a
        24  medial synovial plica band.
        25      A.   You did good.  That's correct.
  00024:01           So just like we talked about before, inside the
        02  knee -- this is not -- if I had the color picture, it'd
        03  be great.  But this is that medial synovial plica band,
        04  so it's a thick band of tissue that sits there.  And you
        05  can see here even in the black and white -- I feel like
        06  I'm back in the '70s with TV.  Even in the black and
        07  white, you can see it's rubbing on the condyle.  So when
        08  you -- this is kind of a pain generator, too.
        09           So you don't want to do a great job fixing the
        10  meniscus and having the patient go, "Yeah.  It still
        11  hurts me right here."  So this plica band is a direct
        12  relation to a traumatic event, so we remove this when we
        13  go in there.  So this is the before and then here's the
        14  after.  You can see it's gone.  So that's kind of a --
        15  that's kind of part of it, but you did good.
        16      Q.   Well, the last one, I think, is going to be my
        17  biggest challenge because it's a long one.  But --
        18      A.   Yeah.
        19      Q.   -- I'd like -- I'd like you to describe in
        20  greater detail what, exactly, this -- this -- what you
        21  performed here and this procedure that you performed in
        22  Item 4, an intercondylar notch marrow stimulation
        23  microfracture chondroplasty for a biological healing
        24  response to the meniscal repair.
        25      A.   Correct.  So kind of the standard of care in
  00025:01  any meniscal repair is to add a marrow stimulation
        02  technique.  Some people will inject platelet-rich plasma
        03  directly to the repair.  The antiquated version was take
        04  someone's blood products, make a clot out of it, and
        05  then you insert the clot into the repair.  But an easier
        06  way that we found, the guys at the
        07  University of Pittsburgh found that if you just take an
        08  area where the notch is -- so I'll show you on this
        09  picture of where I am.
        10           So I'm right here in the notch.  And there --
        11  this is chock-full of really good marrow and the marrow
        12  has got the stem cells and the healing cells for
        13  everything that we want.  So what we do is we make
        14  insertional points here and then the marrow free flows
        15  down into those channels and it'll bathe the repair.
        16  And marrow stimulation has shown two things:  One, it
        17  helps in the repair of -- the speed of the repair, but
        18  it also prevents retear.  So it's basically using --
        19  it's using your own body's beautiful milieu of healing
        20  factors in your marrow that's right there for the taking
        21  and helping the healing response of that meniscus
        22  repair.
        23      Q.   Thank you, Doctor.
        24           And I think you've already kind of covered it,
        25  but you identified tears in the knee.  Significant
  00026:01  tears, I think, is how you described it.
        02           But that's what caused you to recommend and
        03  perform these procedures to Brandon's right knee; is
        04  that fair?
        05      A.   Yes, sir.
        06      Q.   Now, as for the procedures, are these invasive
        07  medical procedures?
        08      A.   So all surgery's invasive no matter what, even
        09  if you have a toenail removed, so it's surgery.  The
        10  fact that it's minimally invasive doesn't mean that it
        11  doesn't have surgical risks.  They all have surgical
        12  risks.  You can die.  You can have a blood clot.  You
        13  can have a heart attack.  You can have a stroke.
        14  There's many things.  You can get an infection.
        15           Though the risks are small, though the risks
        16  are minimal for minimally-invasive surgery, it's still
        17  surgery.  And even though we make it look really cool
        18  because we do it arthroscopically, it's still surgery.
        19  I mean, you still have anesthesia and you still have
        20  risks of lung infections, pneumonia, things like that.
        21  So, I mean, like anything else, we -- we treat it as a
        22  surgery even though it is minimally invasive.
        23      Q.   And did Brandon lose parts of the knee -- his
        24  knee anatomy as a result?
        25      A.   He did.  He lost about 40 percent of his medial
  00027:01  meniscus and that's that large chunky flap tear I showed
        02  you that looked like a -- kind of a rusty gate popping
        03  out or part of a tongue popping in and out, so yeah.  He
        04  lost 40 percent of his meniscus.
        05      Q.   As for the procedures, Doctor, I want you to
        06  kind of describe what expected outcomes -- what are the
        07  expected outcomes, if you could describe them for us?
        08      A.   I will.  And I -- I've actually done a lecture
        09  on this and I lectured it to my residents.  It's called
        10  the young patient with the old knee.
        11           So he's 31 now.  He's what we call -- and this
        12  is the lean-in moment.  This is the lean-in for the
        13  jury.  This is the lean-in part.  This is -- he's
        14  meniscal deficient.  And what that means is on one side
        15  of his knee, he's got a normal meniscus on the outside
        16  part.  On the inside part of the knee, he's missing
        17  40 percent, which means he's got a 60-percent meniscus
        18  here and a 100-percent meniscus here.
        19           So over the course of time -- look at the knee
        20  right here.  Over the course of time, this part of the
        21  knee where the 40 percent is gone will start to get
        22  degenerative, get wear, get what we call post-traumatic
        23  arthritis.  This side of the knee will be fine because
        24  it's got a full bumper.  So like the pool ball on a
        25  bumper on a pool table, this one doesn't have a full
  00028:01  bumper.  This one's got about a 60-percent bumper.  So
        02  over the course of time, not now, not next year, not the
        03  year after, but when Brandon Paige is about 45ish, the
        04  studies show 10 to 12 years, he will 100 percent have a
        05  degenerative medial compartment of his knee with early
        06  osteoarthritic changes.  That's a fact.
        07      Q.   Doctor, what is the expected time frame for him
        08  to recover from the actual procedures?
        09      A.   So for meniscal repairs, most patients recover
        10  in about 12 weeks.
        11      Q.   And after that 12-week mark, are they bearing
        12  weight regularly on the knee?
        13      A.   So we let them bear weight 50 percent the first
        14  three weeks and then we let them go full weight-bearing
        15  in four weeks.  And then usually by twelve weeks,
        16  they're able to have normal gait, meaning normal
        17  walking.  They're able to do -- walk on treadmill.
        18  They're able to do biking, swimming.  They're able to do
        19  in-line activities.  What does that mean?  So walking in
        20  line, riding a bike in line, but they're not allowed to
        21  do pivoting activities for six months, pivoting being
        22  racquetball, basketball, volleyball, pickleball, any of
        23  these side-to-side activities.  And then we also protect
        24  the repair with a brace for six months.
        25      Q.   Doctor, you were describing Brandon's future
  00029:01  and what you might expect in the future starting at 45
        02  or around that age.
        03           Would you expect there to be some limited range
        04  of motion?
        05      A.   Yes.
        06      Q.   And pain would come along with that; is that
        07  fair?
        08      A.   Yes.
        09      Q.   Will Brandon's knee ever be 100 percent back to
        10  normal?
        11      A.   No.  Normal ended when he tore his meniscus
        12  out.
        13      Q.   You -- have you ever experienced some patients
        14  avoiding or doing less exercise and less -- being less
        15  mobile due to this type of injury?
        16      A.   All the time.
        17      Q.   And does that carry on through life, 45 and
        18  beyond?
        19      A.   Throughout life until the inevitable happens
        20  and they need some sort of replacement surgery.
        21      Q.   Okay.  So before a replacement surgery, is
        22  there -- well, follow-up care for the -- for the
        23  procedures themselves, what do you -- what did -- what
        24  would you have Brandon do or what did you have Brandon
        25  do, I suppose?
  00030:01      A.   So for right now, Brandon could be Brandon.  He
        02  can wear a sports knee brace and he can go on with his
        03  life.  He's only 31.
        04           When Brandon starts to say in five to six
        05  years, "My knee hurts when I jog.  My knee hurts when I
        06  play with my kids.  My knee hurts when I am going to the
        07  amusement park," and then you get an MRI on Brandon and
        08  you see that his cartilage -- on his covering cartilage
        09  is wearing down and it's starting to get degenerative,
        10  then you start broaching the subject of biologics.  And
        11  biologics are gel supplementation to the knee mixed with
        12  platelet-rich plasma injections and the potential --
        13  there's a new one out called fractionated adipose tissue
        14  where you take some abdominal adipose tissue,
        15  fractionate it down, and inject that into the knee.
        16           And those all have been shown in studies to do
        17  three things:  One, take away the symptomatology, i.e.,
        18  pain; two, slow down the process of degenerative --
        19  that's the buzzword, slow down the process of the
        20  degenerative process; and number three, at least with
        21  platelet-rich plasma, help some of the building
        22  blocks -- and the gel injection, also.  Sorry -- help
        23  some of the building blocks of the early degenerative
        24  cartilage restore themselves.
        25      Q.   As far as the development of any osteoarthritis
  00031:01  or arthritis, is that at a much earlier age that
        02  Brandon -- you would expect Brandon to potentially have
        03  those symptoms from those types of conditions?
        04      A.   Yes.
        05           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        06      the record.
        07           Sorry, Doctor.
        08           THE WITNESS:  It's okay.  Yes.
        09  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        10      Q.   Let me -- let -- let me ask this in a little
        11  different way.
        12           Can Brandon's injuries in his right knee lead
        13  to the development of osteoarthritis at an earlier age
        14  than it would without the injury?
        15      A.   100 percent.  Yes.  That's -- that's well
        16  documented in over a thousand papers on post-traumatic
        17  arthritis of the knee.  The big ones are meniscal
        18  deficiency.  Once you're meniscal deficient of over
        19  20 percent, it escalates.
        20      Q.   And you had testified that Brandon was
        21  40-percent deficient, correct?
        22      A.   Yes.
        23      Q.   What are some typical symptoms that he might
        24  experience -- or you might expect him to experience in
        25  the future?
  00032:01      A.   Medial pain, meaning pain on the inside part of
        02  his knee.  Number two is swelling.  Number three is the
        03  feeling of giving way.  Number four is the deformity of
        04  the knee starts to collapse on the inside parts of the
        05  knee.  For him, would start to look a little more
        06  bowlegged.  He'd start to see his knee bending inward.
        07  The next one would be nighttime pain, pain that wakes
        08  you up at night.  The next is difficulty getting up and
        09  down out of a chair, climbing stairs, getting in and out
        10  of a car, and up and down off a toilet seat.
        11           So your activities of daily living get
        12  compromised.  And then with that, because of the
        13  degenerative joint line that is starting to wear and
        14  tear on the cartilage, starting to look like shag carpet
        15  or crab meat, it's getting all shaggy and degenerative,
        16  you start to lose range of motion.
        17      Q.   Would you expect these issues with the knee
        18  that you're describing in the future, would you expect
        19  them to cause any other issues to, say, his back or his
        20  hip?
        21      A.   So --
        22           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        23      the records.
        24           You can go ahead.
        25           THE WITNESS:  You know, out of my realm.  We
  00033:01      call it the kinetic chain.  More of a physiatrist
        02      role, physical medicine and rehab role to comment on
        03      that, but, I mean, the kinetic chain is what it is.
        04      And if you have a degenerative knee on one side and
        05      not on the other, intuitively -- and I don't know
        06      from -- I don't have the -- the bandwidth to tell
        07      you the papers out there or the research of it.  But
        08      intuitively, I would think that it would cause a
        09      disruption in the kinetic chain, which would then
        10      cause associated probable hip pain, back pain.
        11  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        12      Q.   Would you expect him to compensate on his
        13  good -- his good -- well, compensate for the injured leg
        14  on his good leg?
        15      A.   So it's hard to say.  It depends on when we
        16  talk about compensate.  Like I said, it's -- it's not
        17  now.  It's not next year.  It's not a year from now.
        18  It's about ten years from now.  And then when you say
        19  "compensate," usually it's not compensating.  It's
        20  usually the other leg is -- is deficient and so you
        21  start to see more of a limping and more of an antalgic
        22  gait, meaning that they're not able to move the knee as
        23  best as they can on their good knee.
        24      Q.   Doctor, if Brandon's still experiencing some
        25  symptoms or some pain in his knee, in your opinion, is
  00034:01  it likely never going away?
        02      A.   I -- you know, that's one of those questions
        03  that when you are subjective and you have subjective
        04  knee pain, you're going to have good days and bad days.
        05  You're going to have some treatments.  Like I said, you
        06  can have the gel injections, the PRP injections.  I
        07  wouldn't recommend corticosteroid injections.  It's kind
        08  of been -- been thrown out by our academy.
        09           But you're going to have good days and bad
        10  days.  The good days are going to come and then the bad
        11  days are going to be if you went and walked around
        12  Disney for eight hours with your kids, you're going to
        13  have a bad day.
        14      Q.   Would you classify Brandon's injuries from the
        15  June 6, 2020, incident as being permanent injuries?
        16      A.   Absolutely.
        17      Q.   And I know you were alluding to some -- some
        18  treatment in the future, potential treatment.
        19           I'll just ask you straightaway:  Would Brandon
        20  benefit from continued examinations and treatment
        21  related to this right knee injury in the future?
        22           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        23      the reports.
        24           THE WITNESS:  No, absolutely.  Whatever -- you
        25      know, the standard right now for meniscal deficiency
  00035:01      on a young individual is he needs to be seen every
        02      six months with imaging studies being x-rays and a
        03      postoperative MRI done, minimal, at years one,
        04      three, and five for a lot of reasons:  One, to look
        05      at the cartilage; two, to look at the repair; and,
        06      three, to start documenting any early -- what we
        07      call chondromalacia, a fancy term for cartilage
        08      thinning or wear of the articular cartilage leading
        09      to early degenerative joint changes.
        10           Some of the athletes I've seen have shown
        11      dramatic arthritic changes within five years because
        12      they're high-profile athletes and that's their job.
        13      So even though they're meniscal deficient, they
        14      still go back to playing NFL, NHL, or MLB.  And
        15      because of that, they're at a higher risk, so their
        16      risk factors of having a degenerative knee escalate
        17      tenfold.  Depending on what he does -- I think at
        18      the time we saw him, he may have been a driver for
        19      DoorDash, but it depends on what his recreational
        20      activities are.  If he is a highflier with
        21      recreational activities, softball, basketball,
        22      volleyball, he's going to increase his degenerative
        23      changes, once again, two X or three X.
        24  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        25      Q.   Do you have an opinion as to whether you would
  00036:01  expect future surgical intervention for Brandon's --
        02           MS. VERONA:  Objection -- sorry.
        03           THE WITNESS:  So knowing what I know --
        04  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        05      Q.   Let me ask that again.
        06      A.   Okay.  Okay.
        07      Q.   Doctor, do you have an opinion as to whether
        08  you would expect future surgical intervention on the
        09  right knee of Brandon as he gets older?
        10           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        11      the reports.
        12           You can go ahead, Doctor.
        13           THE WITNESS:  So it's my professional opinion
        14      within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that
        15      Mr. Paige will need future surgical intervention,
        16      whether that be joint resurfacing as a
        17      minimally-invasive procedure and/or total knee
        18      replacement arthroplasty, because being that much
        19      meniscal deficiency, his knee is going to get wiped
        20      out.  And I can tell you that, under oath, his
        21      knee's going to be wiped out within 20 years.
        22  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        23      Q.   So based on that, Brandon may expect to get a
        24  knee replacement in his 50's?
        25      A.   Well, let's hope not.  I mean, we try to keep
  00037:01  them -- there -- it's happened.  So let me -- let me
        02  throw this out at you.
        03           I say to my residents when I'm teaching them, I
        04  say, "See all those total knee replacements on the
        05  surgical board right there?"
        06           And I'll say -- and they'll look at me and go,
        07  "Yeah, Dr. MacLaren, I see.  There's about ten knee
        08  replacements on the board for surgeries today."
        09           I say, "Look at the ages.  Look at the ages.
        10  One's 75."  I said, "One's 56."  I said, "Why would a
        11  56-year-old need that knee replacement right now?"  And
        12  they look at me and I say, "Remember the paper I gave
        13  you on meniscal deficiency?  Where do you think those
        14  total knees come from?"  So that's it.
        15           So, I mean, we hope not, but is it a -- is it a
        16  fact?  Yeah.  I mean, in those 50-year-olds that are
        17  getting total knee replacements every day at
        18  Tampa General and every other hospital, they've had a
        19  traumatic event in their younger years because
        20  degenerative knees just don't pop up and happen.  And --
        21  and if you're that bad to have a total knee replacement
        22  in your 50's, you had an antecedent event happen to you
        23  in your 20's or your 30's.  Unfortunately, some of them
        24  happen when they are in their teen ages.  They had a
        25  meniscal tear as a teenager playing sports and now they
  00038:01  have a total knee coming in their 50's.
        02      Q.   As to a knee replacement, what -- what does
        03  that surgery entail?
        04           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        05      the report.
        06           THE WITNESS:  So I don't do them.  I have done
        07      them.  It's been 20 years since I've done them, but,
        08      I mean, it's a large incision down the center of the
        09      knee.  You basically resect parts of the knee and
        10      you replace them with metal and plastic, from a
        11      layman's perspective.
        12  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        13      Q.   Is the need for a knee replacement at an
        14  earlier age common when someone has sustained injuries
        15  such as Brandon?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        18      the report.
        19           Doctor --
        20           MR. BEATTIE:  And --
        21           MS. VERONA:  -- can you go ahead and answer it
        22      again just so that, that way, the record's clear
        23      later?
        24           THE WITNESS:  Yes.
        25  BY MR. BEATTIE:
  00039:01      Q.   Doctor, let's assume Brandon won't need a knee
        02  replacement in the future.  You were describing some
        03  other, I guess, less-invasive procedure and I can't
        04  recall exactly what you said.
        05           But -- but what is that and can you describe
        06  it?
        07      A.   Sure.  So --
        08           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside the scope of
        09      the report.
        10           You can go ahead.
        11           THE WITNESS:  Sure.  So I'm a sports med
        12      surgeon, right?  I'm not a total knee surgeon.  So
        13      I'm the guy who offers everything but knee
        14      replacement surgery until it's necessary.  So when
        15      someone's in that in-betweener category where it's
        16      painful, painful, but it's not bad enough that you
        17      want to do a knee replacement, I offer them three
        18      things, right?
        19           So the first thing we offer is
        20      viscosupplementation.  It's like an oil change of
        21      the knee.  It's called the gel injection.  You
        22      probably heard of the gel.  Someone might've been
        23      talking about it:  "Yeah.  They put the gel in my
        24      knee."
        25           So it's a gel injection.  It's basically the
  00040:01      same components cartilage is made out of, hyaluronic
        02      acid, chondroitin sulfate.  We inject that.  The
        03      second additive to that is called platelet-rich
        04      plasma.  You probably heard of all the athletes in
        05      the NFL and they go and get PRP injections, PRP
        06      here.  Tiger Woods had PRP.  Kobe Bryant used to get
        07      PRP all the time.  But what it is, is we draw your
        08      blood.  We spin it down and we take the healing
        09      factors in your blood and we inject that into the
        10      knee.  There's 3,500 studies on the knee and PRP out
        11      there and it's the heavy lifter of knee pain and
        12      pathology, meaning that it works as an analgesic to
        13      knee pain and it also acts as a slowdown to
        14      osteoarthritic changes that's been proven on
        15      level-one studies.
        16           The third modality is new and it's been
        17      approved by Medicare and Medicaid, CMS.  It's called
        18      fractionated adipose tissue.  They take a small
        19      piece of adipose tissue from your abdomen.  They
        20      fractionate it, meaning they take some of the cells
        21      that are healing-factor cells and inject that into
        22      the knee.  It has been shown in level-one studies
        23      to, once again, slow down the progression of
        24      osteoarthritic changes, decrease the pain, and
        25      increase the functionality of the knee.  Those are
  00041:01      the three biologics that I would offer.
        02           A fourth modality, which I don't think is
        03      necessary at the time, but you can do a cartilage
        04      grafting.  Arthroscopically, you can put a camera in
        05      the knee and you can find the divots and the defects
        06      and then you can graft it with a new cartilage paste
        07      that we have out on the market and you can graft the
        08      defects with that.  Hopefully, that will work.  In
        09      my hands, I've only done a handful of them, maybe
        10      two.
        11           And they're out there.  People are doing them.
        12      There are cartilage grafting technique.  They have a
        13      bunch of different names to them.  One's called
        14      DeNovo.  The other one is called -- what is that one
        15      called now?  Used to be called Carticel.  It's
        16      basically a cartilage grafting technique where you
        17      fill in the defects.  For layman's terms and for the
        18      jury, it's like filling a pothole, potholes that are
        19      in the knee, and you fill it with the cartilage
        20      compound.
        21           Those would be the precursors to anything --
        22      that's -- that's (sic) would be what I would do as a
        23      sports surgeon as opposed to a total knee surgeon.
        24      But once again, the disclaimer on those is you have
        25      to fit the category.  You can't have a wiped-out
  00042:01      arthritic knee and expect those to work.
        02  BY MR. BEATTIE:
        03      Q.   Would you expect Brandon to fit the category
        04  down the road in his 50's?
        05      A.   I -- I -- if he came to see me in his 40's, I
        06  would offer those four modalities.
        07           I just remembered the last one's called
        08  AutoCart, A-U-T-O Cart, as in autologous cartilage,
        09  meaning we're using your own cartilage that we're
        10  salvaging -- I'm sorry.  We're harvesting and we're
        11  replacing it, robbing Peter to pay Paul, replacing it in
        12  the areas of defect.  So those four modalities I would
        13  definitely offer someone in their 40's or early 50's as
        14  a sports surgeon.
        15      Q.   Doctor, has all the treatment that you've
        16  rendered Brandon Paige been reasonable?
        17      A.   Yes, sir.
        18      Q.   Has all that treatment that you've rendered to
        19  Brandon Paige been necessary?
        20      A.   Yes, sir.
        21      Q.   And last question, Doctor:  Have all your
        22  opinions you've given today been more likely than not
        23  within a reasonable degree of medical certainty and
        24  probability?
        25      A.   Yes, sir.
  00043:01           MR. BEATTIE:  Thank you, Doctor.
        02                      CROSS-EXAMINATION
        03  BY MS. VERONA:
        04      Q.   Dr. MacLaren, I have some follow-up questions
        05  for you.
        06           My understanding based on the testimony you
        07  just gave is that your only knowledge about the Circle K
        08  incident is that Mr. Paige suffered a slip and fall due
        09  to water on the floor; is that right?
        10      A.   Correct.
        11      Q.   You did not get any history from Mr. Paige of
        12  this loading and twisting of the knee occurring in this
        13  fall; isn't that true?
        14      A.   Mr. Paige stated -- looking through the initial
        15  evals.
        16           He does not describe the mechanism of his
        17  injury.
        18      Q.   And did you have an opportunity to review his
        19  deposition transcript?
        20      A.   I did not.
        21      Q.   Are you aware that in the deposition
        22  transcript, he indicated that he action (sic) slipped
        23  in -- he slipped and fell onto his back?  Are you aware
        24  of that?
        25      A.   I saw that in one of the notes, but I did not
  00044:01  read his deposition.  But I think it says:  Initial
        02  eval, the patient fell, impacted his back.
        03      Q.   So as we sit here today, you have no evidence
        04  to give this jury that Mr. Paige suffered a
        05  load-and-twist injury to his knee in the fall at
        06  Circle K; isn't that true?
        07           MR. BEATTIE:  Form.
        08           THE WITNESS:  No, that's not true.  The
        09      evidence I have is seeing a split horizontal
        10      cleavage tear with a displaced fragment that can
        11      only happen from a twisting injury to the knee.  So
        12      intuitively, as an educated individual, I'm
        13      thinking, I mean, you don't -- you don't slip on the
        14      water and go on your back.  You slip on the water,
        15      twist your knee, then you go on your back because
        16      there has to be -- there has to be a mechanism that
        17      goes through the knee in order for you to go to
        18      ground.  Just like when --
        19  BY MS. VERONA:
        20      Q.   Mr. Paige could've --
        21      A.   -- someone says -- if someone -- like, I'm a
        22  sports medicine guy, right?  I spend a lot of my time
        23  out in the sidelines.
        24           When someone says, "That guy took a hit up top
        25  to the shoulder and then flew in the air and landed on
  00045:01  his back," well, his back hurt, but his shoulder was
        02  dislocated.  And so it's the cause and the effect.  So
        03  it's not the fact that he fell on his back.  It's the
        04  fact that he twisted his knee, then slipped, then fell
        05  on his back.
        06      Q.   Well, Mr. Paige could've suffered a twisting
        07  injury to his knee in someplace or some other form other
        08  than the fall at Circle K; isn't that right?
        09           MR. BEATTIE:  Form.
        10           THE WITNESS:  Well, maybe.  But I'll be honest
        11      with -- there's no way he walked around with that
        12      knee like that prior to that -- even if -- if he
        13      injured that knee prior to the Circle K and he was
        14      walking around on that knee for months before that,
        15      I'd give him credit because that's a horrible
        16      meniscus tear.
        17  BY MS. VERONA:
        18      Q.   Well, that's actually interesting that you
        19  bring that up, because isn't it true that Mr. Paige's
        20  first treatment for right knee complaints was at
        21  Complete Care on August 14, 2020, two-and-a-half months
        22  after the fall at Circle K occurred?
        23      A.   That is his first visit.  Correct.
        24      Q.   And isn't it true, then, that after you saw him
        25  on October 19, 2020, Mr. Paige then waited at least
  00046:01  another six months before undergoing the surgery in
        02  March of 2021?
        03      A.   Correct.  But the patients are not able to just
        04  say -- it's not like fast food.
        05           They can't say, "Hey.  Let's have my surgery
        06  next week."  So there's a process.  And so that does not
        07  surprise me that the process took that, particularly in
        08  the world of personal injury and legal.
        09      Q.   Well, in total, Mr. Paige was able to continue
        10  walking on his knee for a total of ten months from the
        11  time of this alleged fall at Circle K, June 6, 2020,
        12  until he underwent surgery with you on March 30, 2021;
        13  isn't that right?
        14      A.   He might've been walking, but wasn't he
        15  symptomatic the whole time?  According to the records,
        16  he was with a seven out of ten on a pain scale the
        17  entire time, affecting his activities of living.
        18      Q.   And according to the history provided to you by
        19  Mr. Paige, as documented in your medical records and as
        20  documented in his sworn deposition testimony, he not
        21  once gave a history of twisting his knee in the fall at
        22  Circle K; isn't that right?
        23      A.   I don't have it documented.  But once again,
        24  I'm -- I'm going to say intuitively, as an educated
        25  orthopedic surgeon who teaches this -- and I teach
  00047:01  mechanisms of injury and I've lectured
        02  nationally/internationally on knee meniscus injuries --
        03  that's the only way that can happen.
        04      Q.   Are you aware that Mr. Paige used to be
        05  involved in what -- what he referred to as MMA, mixed
        06  martial arts?
        07      A.   I am not.
        08      Q.   Okay.  And what -- are you familiar with mixed
        09  martial arts?
        10      A.   I was the team physician for mixed martial arts
        11  Bellator for seven years while I had the D1 Sports Med
        12  center.
        13      Q.   And when you're performing the maneuvers in
        14  mixed marshal arts, could you have twisted or rotated
        15  your knee?
        16      A.   Yes.
        17      Q.   Are you aware that Mr. Paige was a
        18  long-distance runner before the fall at Circle K in
        19  June 2020?
        20      A.   It's not in the records, but if you tell me
        21  that, I would believe it.
        22      Q.   Does long-distance running increase the stress
        23  on people's knees?
        24      A.   There's not any papers out there that show that
        25  long-distance running is inhibitive or precursor to
  00048:01  meniscal injury.
        02      Q.   Are you aware that Mr. Paige is six feet, four
        03  inches tall and weighs 270 pounds?
        04      A.   That is what is written in his medical records.
        05      Q.   Does height and weight play any role in
        06  increasing stress in the knees?
        07      A.   That's a great question because that's one of
        08  my resident debates.  There's not any paper out there
        09  that shows that body habitus or body morphology shows
        10  any direct correlation to increased incidence of injury
        11  to the knee.
        12      Q.   So it's -- I didn't talk about injury.  I
        13  just -- talking about stress on the knees.  It's your
        14  testimony, then, to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury
        15  that Mr. Paige being 270 pounds plays no role in wear
        16  and tear or stress on his knees.
        17      A.   That is correct.  And I look at it as I have
        18  NFL linemen in my practice that are that same size that
        19  do not have any pathology to their knee after a career
        20  of five to ten years.
        21      Q.   And likewise, it's your testimony to the ladies
        22  and gentlemen of the jury that Mr. Paige will not have
        23  any increased stress or wear and tear on his knees
        24  because of long-distance running.
        25      A.   He will not have any increase if he had a
  00049:01  normal knee.  He will have an increase now because he's
        02  40-percent meniscal deficient.  So running on normal
        03  menisci, no.  Running on abnormal, deficient menisci,
        04  yes.
        05      Q.   And speaking of abnormal menisci, you're aware,
        06  of course, that Mr. Paige had a meniscal tear in the
        07  other knee, the left knee, back in 2012?
        08      A.   That is in his records, correct, that he
        09  stated.
        10      Q.   And you did not review any MRIs or operative
        11  reports following that injury, correct?
        12      A.   We did ask for them.  He had no records and
        13  nothing to share with us.
        14      Q.   Okay.  Are you aware that Mr. Paige testified
        15  under oath at his deposition that he suffered a meniscal
        16  tear in 2012 not because of any particular trauma, but
        17  just because of wear and tear?
        18      A.   I did not review his deposition.
        19      Q.   And that 2012 meniscal tear required surgery.
        20           You're aware of that, right?
        21      A.   Yes, ma'am.
        22      Q.   Not every meniscal tear requires surgery; is
        23  that right?
        24      A.   That is correct.
        25      Q.   But in this particular case with Mr. Paige,
  00050:01  after ten months following the fall at Circle K, you did
        02  do surgery in March 2021, correct?
        03      A.   Correct.
        04      Q.   And he had a good result from that surgery?
        05      A.   To the best of my knowledge and what we have
        06  discussed, yes.
        07      Q.   You referred him to physical therapy following
        08  the surgical procedure, correct?
        09      A.   Correct.
        10      Q.   And isn't it true that he was discharged from
        11  physical therapy because he was not returning to the
        12  therapy appointments?
        13      A.   I do not have that knowledge.
        14      Q.   Isn't it also true that Mr. Paige failed to
        15  appear at two follow-up visits at Complete Care on
        16  June 1, 2021, and June 16, 2021?
        17      A.   To the best of my knowledge, he did not follow
        18  up as scheduled after his first postop visit on
        19  4/13 of '21.
        20      Q.   So no one at Complete Care has seen Mr. Paige
        21  related to his knee since April of 2021, correct?
        22      A.   Correct.
        23      Q.   And so you're not aware of his current medical
        24  condition as it relates to the right knee?
        25      A.   Not other than what I've read in his postop
  00051:01  report, 4/13 of 2021.
        02      Q.   And you are not aware of his current daily
        03  activities or hobbies or sports that he's participating
        04  in?
        05      A.   I am not.
        06      Q.   And I think you called it earlier a, quote,
        07  lean-in moment for the jury when you were talking about
        08  the condition that he may suffer from in the future.
        09           So going back to that lean-in moment, you,
        10  then, have not seen Mr. Paige since early 2021 and you
        11  have no idea about his current medical condition; is
        12  that right?
        13      A.   That is correct, but what you're talking about
        14  is incorrect.  The lean-in moment is the definition of
        15  meniscal deficiency, not Mr. Paige's condition.  It's
        16  the definition of him being 40-percent meniscal
        17  deficient, has a 100-percent chance of him having a
        18  degenerative knee in the next 20 years.  And that's well
        19  documented in multiple level-one study papers throughout
        20  the orthopedic literature.  That's the lean-in moment.
        21      Q.   You'll agree with me that despite the lean-in
        22  moment that he'll have 100 percent chance of having
        23  degeneration, you have no idea whether or not Mr. Paige
        24  would ever undergo any of the procedures that you've
        25  laid out for the jury today, right?
  00052:01      A.   I do not.  I have not seen it.
        02      Q.   And, in fact, on -- on that same subject of
        03  having no idea what he's going to undergo in the future,
        04  he didn't -- he didn't -- didn't even complete the
        05  postoperative recommendations that you gave him back in
        06  2021, right?
        07      A.   It appears so.
        08           MS. VERONA:  All right.  I don't have any other
        09      questions for you.  Thank you so much, Dr. MacLaren.
        10           THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.
        11                    REDIRECT EXAMINATION
        12  BY MS. BEATTIE:
        13      Q.   Doctor, just a few questions.  You mentioned
        14  meniscal deficiency.
        15           And you diagnosed Brandon Paige with a meniscal
        16  deficiency, correct?
        17      A.   Correct.
        18      Q.   And is that because he has only 60 percent of
        19  his meniscus at this time after the surgery?
        20      A.   On his medial side, being the inside part of
        21  his knee, he is currently -- has a repaired 60 percent
        22  left of his medial meniscus.
        23      Q.   So 40 percent of that is gone.
        24      A.   Gone and never coming back.
        25      Q.   And the reason why 40 percent of that is gone,
  00053:01  is -- is it because he sustained an acute injury?
        02      A.   Correct.
        03      Q.   And you had testified earlier that this acute
        04  injury that you identified from reviewing the records
        05  during a physical examination of Brandon Paige, looking
        06  at the MRIs, and talking to him, that he -- his meniscus
        07  deficiency was a -- I'm sorry.  I lost my train of
        08  thought.
        09           All right.  Let's start over.
        10           Doctor, you had testified that you diagnosed
        11  him with a meniscal deficiency and that he had lost
        12  40 percent of that portion of his meniscus, correct?
        13      A.   Yes, sir.
        14      Q.   And that the deficiency is because of the
        15  surgery that you performed where you had to remove
        16  portion of it, correct?
        17      A.   Yes, sir.
        18      Q.   And that portion was 40 percent?
        19      A.   Yes, sir.
        20      Q.   And the reason why you performed that surgery
        21  was due to an acute injury, correct?
        22      A.   Yes, sir.
        23      Q.   And this is where I was going:  As far as the
        24  acute injury, you identified this acute injury as an
        25  injury that's -- that occurs because of a
  00054:01  twisting-knee-type fall --
        02      A.   That is correct.
        03      Q.   -- or when you twist your knee, I suppose, is
        04  what you -- I think you testified to.
        05      A.   Correct.  The -- the configuration I showed
        06  you, as I showed you before, with a horizontal split
        07  tear with a piece that's fragmented out can only happen
        08  with a twisting type and -- and what we call a shearing
        09  mechanism.  It's got to shear that meniscus in a
        10  twisting type.  When Ms. Verona alluded to the fact that
        11  there are some that are not operative versus some that
        12  are operative, if you have a radial tear that we call
        13  nondisplaced -- so it's nondisplaced, it's not moving,
        14  it's not doing anything -- you can leave those alone and
        15  they'll be fine.  The ones that are displaced, that have
        16  a piece, a chunk of it torn off and flipped over into
        17  the joint, there's no alternative.  You have -- you have
        18  to take care of that.  You have to surgically remove and
        19  repair that.
        20      Q.   And what you were just describing, that's what
        21  you were showing in the pictures earlier in this
        22  deposition, correct?
        23      A.   Correct.  I showed it as a -- a black-and-white
        24  piece.  And you can actually see -- I mean, this is a --
        25  it's a beautiful image.  Bad for him, but good for the
  00055:01  image.
        02           This is a piece -- that -- that whole chunk,
        03  that whole 40-percent piece is flipped over on itself
        04  and sitting in the middle of his joint right there.  I
        05  mean, that's -- that's a dead piece of tissue, but it's
        06  still causing symptoms and so that has to go.  And then
        07  the rest of it we have to repair to prevent this from
        08  going from 60 percent left to 20 percent left.
        09      Q.   And those injuries that you were just showing
        10  us on the picture, could those injuries be caused by a
        11  twisting knee event as you fall backwards?
        12      A.   Yes.
        13      Q.   Can you twist your knee falling backwards?
        14      A.   Yes.
        15      Q.   Is that a common way to twist your knee?
        16      A.   Most of the time I see someone fall, they have
        17  a knee injury to it because there's a twisting mechanism
        18  going on with the knee.
        19      Q.   Would you kind of describe that as a poor -- a
        20  poor-splits-type mechanism?
        21      A.   I would just describe it as a torsion or a
        22  shear-force mechanism.
        23      Q.   And as far as the recovery from the surgery
        24  that -- that you performed, will a younger person
        25  generally recover faster from that type --
  00056:01           MS. VERONA:  Objection.  Outside -- sorry.
        02      Outside the scope of direct -- or cross.
        03           THE WITNESS:  I can't say that because you can
        04      have a young, unhealthy person versus a 55-year-old,
        05      super-fit person and the super-fit, healthy person
        06      at 55's going to heal better.  It just depends on
        07      your fitness level.  It depends on your motivation
        08      and it depends on your genetics.  And so I can't
        09      really put that in a box and say that.
        10           MR. BEATTIE:  Okay.  All right, Doctor.  That's
        11      all the questions I have for you.
        12           THE REPORTER:  Are you -- any more questions?
        13           Okay.  Is this a read or a waive?
        14           MR. BEATTIE:  Oh.  I'm sorry.
        15           We'll -- Doctor, do you want to waive or read?
        16           THE WITNESS:  Oh.  I'll waive.
        17           MS. VERONA:  Yeah.  It's for trial, so he
        18      doesn't --
        19           MR. BEATTIE:  Yeah.
        20           MS. VERONA:  -- he doesn't do that.
        21           THE REPORTER:  Okay.
        22           MR. BEATTIE:  Yeah.  Sorry.  I -- I didn't know
        23      what -- I couldn't hear you.  And I lost my train of
        24      thought because of my chicken scratch on this page.
        25           MS. VERONA:  Oh.  Listen.  It happens to all of
  00057:01      us.  That's why I was, like, laughing because I'm
        02      like, that's when you just got to be like, okay,
        03      just start this whole thing over.
        04           MR. BEATTIE:  Yeah, just start it over.  That's
        05      the best part about the video.  I can just start it
        06      over.
        07           THE WITNESS:  Right.
        08           MS. VERONA:  Just start this --
        09           THE WITNESS:  Never know --
        10           MS. VERONA:  -- shit over.
        11           THE WITNESS:  That's right.
        12           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Are we ready to go off the
        13      record?
        14           MR. BEATTIE:  Oh.  We're not off?
        15           MS. VERONA:  Yes.
        16           MR. BEATTIE:  Oh, my gosh.  We're on the
        17      record.
        18           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  No.  Sorry.
        19           Okay.  We are off the record.  The time is
        20      2:10 p.m.  This concludes the deposition.
        21           Will anyone be ordering the video?
        22           MR. BEATTIE:  Not at this time.
        23           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
        24           THE REPORTER:  Would anyone like the
        25      transcript?
  00058:01           MR. BEATTIE:  Well, I probably don't need it
        02      right now.
